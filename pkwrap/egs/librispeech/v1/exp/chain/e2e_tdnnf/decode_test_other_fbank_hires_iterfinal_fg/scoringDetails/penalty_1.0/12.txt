lbi-1688-142285-0000 THEY DESIRED THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS AS GOOD BUT IS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY PHIL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL AND IRON 
lbi-1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUESTS DOWNSTAIRS I CANNOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY 
lbi-1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY 
lbi-1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKE AN ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID 
lbi-1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS A THING I LIKE BEST OF ALL 
lbi-1688-142285-0005 YOU ARE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE THINK SHOPPING AT HELSTON 
lbi-1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT INTRODUCING SUCH A SON TO US THAT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN 
lbi-1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS OF SOME PART OF WHAT HE SAID 
lbi-1688-142285-0008 HIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES 
lbi-1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE 
lbi-1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE 
lbi-1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO GAIN HIS OWN PORTRAIT PORTION OF WEALTH 
lbi-1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARD TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY 
lbi-1688-142285-0013 AT LAST MY FRIEND CAME FORWARD IMMEDIATELY AND MISS THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TOTTY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT 
lbi-1688-142285-0014 SO THEN IF NEWTON

lbi-1688-142285-0016 OH PA BY THE TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH 
lbi-1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRAINED IN MAKING MONEY 
lbi-1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THOUGH POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS AS OF THE PALE OF OUR SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH 
lbi-1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT 
lbi-1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WORDS WORDS 
lbi-1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED 
lbi-1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BEFOOL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE 
lbi-1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER AS IT CAME 
lbi-1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO THINK MISS THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL

lbi-1688-142285-0029 THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE 
lbi-1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS INHIBITION FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY 
lbi-1688-142285-0031 AUNT MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DICKSON LIFTED AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING 
lbi-1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVE CARESSES AND FROM WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO MOTHER'S HEALTH 
lbi-1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OR MILTON LIFE FROM HER MOTHER 
lbi-1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT GIVE DICKSON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO A LIFE 
lbi-1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW AND LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS 
lbi-1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSIE HE COMES IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER 
lbi-1688-142285-0037 WELL BESSIE HOW ARE YOU

lbi-1688-142285-0042 OH FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK 
lbi-1688-142285-0043 AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE

lbi-1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSIE DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN 
lbi-1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER WHO GAVE A CHEER AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS

lbi-1688-142285-0089 PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF A PLACE 
lbi-1688-142285-0090 SHE SOUNDED TUBBY SUCH CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LACK ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY 
lbi-1688-142285-0091 I DO SAID MISTER HOME LOVED HARRY TURNED OFF FROM THE NINETY 
lbi-1688-142285-0092 I AM SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
lbi-1688-142285-0093 TAKE NOTICE THAT THIS IS NOT MY KIND OF FORTUNE'S PURPLE FIVE INUTILE WOULDN'T AGREE TO THAT YOU ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT 
lbi-1688-142285-0094 IDA KNEW POSITIVELY THAT IT IS NEITHER FROM LITTLE THINGS I'VE GATHERED FROM AN OFFENSIVE SIR 
lbi-1688-142285-0095 THE KID TOO NATURAL TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER 
lbi-3331-159605-0000 SHE PUSHED AHEAD AND TURN TO GOOD PIC PUT TWO FEET FROM THE FENDER AND TOOK POT ONTO HER LAP OR A FICHU ANGE MOOSE SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER IN SOAK 
lbi-3331-159605-0001 THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MOST CREDIT 
lbi-3331-159605-0002 THAT TRIED IT UNLIGHTED AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN 
lbi-3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT WAS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES 
lbi-3331-159605-0004 WHAT A SPITEFUL THING LIANE 
lbi-3331-159605-0005 I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ART AT HOME HOW I SHOOT IN THE BACK 
lbi-3331-159605-0006 LET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN 
lbi-3331-159605-0007 HE HAS KNOWN HOW ON LIES AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER 
lbi-3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HIM MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE TOUCHING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOUR OF WHOM INSTANTLY HOOKED ON WORKING DAYS 
lbi-3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED PONY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED 
lbi-3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL AND MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED LIES AND GOOD MOTHERS 
lbi-3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THE SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERYONE 
lbi-3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FITTED HIM MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF 
lbi-3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HAUNTS US SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN A CHEWED 
lbi-3331-159605-0014 POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SIDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF PHILOSOPHIC TRUTH ONLY CALLING IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID 
lbi-3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLICE INQUISITION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL BUT THE SPIES OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION 
lbi-3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STUDDED AS HUGH CHAUFFEUR WHO SIT BACK AND BESS BUT COULDN'T RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORE AS TO LEAVE LITTLE PARCEL FAN THAT WAS CONINGTON 
lbi-3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DUCK BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HIS DUTY 
lbi-3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MUSSET CHARLEY'S HAND MISS MAMIE AND LOOK PRETTY LIKE WILLIE AND FLOSSIE SAID THE MATE 
lbi-3331-159605-0019 AT A STREET CORNER AND LIKE A SCHOOLBOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOLGIRL WHOSE MUSIC WILL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING 
lbi-3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER TILL SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET 
lbi-3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULDN'T HELP IT IT IS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY 
lbi-3331-159605-0022 THAT IS TO WAKE UP TO THE LAST ANSWERED POLLY 
lbi-3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT AS FLYING HOOFS WAS A GOOD PUPIL SHE FORGOT HERSELF 
lbi-3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOESN'T PROVE SHE CHOICE TO MENTAL FAULTS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT UNTIL A SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BUT THE MOAN OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT 
lbi-3331-159605-0025 THANK YOU NO 
lbi-3331-159605-0026 HOW LOVELY THE POCKET BOOKS HE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION 
lbi-3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL 
lbi-3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICK TO TAKE A HAND THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS WHO SOUGHT TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR PITY SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN 
lbi-3331-159605-0029 SO SHE MADE HER LAST BRILLIANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I FELT SO NOW I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME AT NIGHT 
lbi-3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TWENTY POUND AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT NATURE EVEN TO TELL A LIE LIKE LEVITY 
lbi-3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP TO HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE LOOKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD WET HIS ENSIGN AND ACCEPT AT HIS HANDS 
lbi-3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO EFFACE WITH WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD LEFT TONE AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE PLACE A PLEASANT AFTER ALL 
lbi-3331-159605-0033 ROCKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU 
lbi-3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS SHE'LL CHILLED HIM 
lbi-3331-159605-0035 UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF 
lbi-3331-159605-0036 MONEY SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PUDDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT WRAPPERS 
lbi-3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED PIETY PURCHASED TOM LIKE A DEER HAS NOT HE PROPOSED 
lbi-3331-159605-0038 DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO 
lbi-3331-159605-0039 TRULY TRULY FAN 
lbi-3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO COMPLAIN BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID 
lbi-3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I COULD ATTEND AND A HALF 
lbi-3331-159605-0042 I JUST GAVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT 
lbi-3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT MOST OF THEM THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN O MINE TO ITS CITY TETLOW SAY 
lbi-3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEATRICE AND LEMON MADE NO FUSS 
lbi-3331-159605-0045 BUT PATTY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU 
lbi-3331-159605-0046 I OUGHT TO KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS 
lbi-3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAD BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE VEST DIVIDED HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM 
lbi-3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERYONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE MISSISSIPPI PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR OMENS OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORK TOGETHER SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS UNUTTERABLE TRICKED UP IN THE RESPECTIVE HUTS 
lbi-3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE ELLA DID ITS WORK AND WEND ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEANER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND BUT THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE THEM FOR THE ICE WITH THEM BECAUSE OF THE PARTING THAT MUST BE 
lbi-3331-159609-0003 IF IT HADN'T A BEEN FOR TWO THINGS A FEW SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY AND CALLED TO HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BECAUSE IN THEM DAYS 
lbi-3331-159609-0004 TO MORROW TOWARDS A VEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR 
lbi-3331-159609-0005 NO I'M ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE POOH 
lbi-3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME PAPA BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FLUTTERS THERE AND NO ONE TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU SAY TO ME IF I CAN 
lbi-3331-159609-0007 I TRIED TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME 
lbi-3331-159609-0008 THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT 
lbi-3331-159609-0009 CRIED POLLY WITH THE HAUGHTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE 
lbi-3331-159609-0010 POOLE PARTY WERE SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY 
lbi-3331-159609-0011 NONE BUT NEEDED ATTENTIVE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE TO HIDE HER HEAD IN A SOFA CUSHION I CAHOON IS ASTONISHED WHEN THE HUNTERS OFTEN 
lbi-3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE PUT HALF CHOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION 
lbi-3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS POOR 
lbi-3331-159609-0014 IT WAS TO ATTEND AN UNDEFINED THAT FANNY TOOK UP THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVE AND ADMIRATION OF PONIES LOYALTY TO HERSELF FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING OF FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS YOU AM CALCULATED THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GHOST THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY 
lbi-3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARIA BAILEY'S OR ANYTHING SIR SHE ADDED SOFTLY I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN 
lbi-3331-159609-0016 SAID FANNY TURNING HOPE FROM OUR ADMISSIONS 
lbi-3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST ENQUIRE AFTER US HOT IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO TELL 
lbi-3331-159609-0018 BUT PEOPLE ALWAYS STUPID THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED PONY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON 
lbi-3331-159609-0019 IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT WHEN FROM THE LAST TO BOTH THE GIRLS 
lbi-3331-159609-0020 IF ANY ONE TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SIDNEY PLEASED WILL HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THE CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM 
lbi-3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANT TO SIT DREAMING OF A BOOK OR SOON ALONE THAN TO EXCITE HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHOPS 
lbi-3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF AT A WINDOW AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST 
lbi-3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE WHOLE BALLY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS 
lbi-3331-159609-0024 THEN HE CAME BOLTING IN UPON ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE PUT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM 
lbi-3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THAT COULD TELL STORIES MOST TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY LEAD 
lbi-3528-168656-0000 SHE HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION 
lbi-3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY DRAGON THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT 
lbi-3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SETS THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR SAINT FRANCOIS GAVE IT TO MONSIEUR SAINT JULIEN MONSIEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSIEUR SAINT EUSEBIUS MUFFLE YOUR FAINT EUSEBIUS GIVE TO MONSIEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA 
lbi-3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOL GIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGH WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHER'S FROWN 
lbi-3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY 
lbi-3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF MONTREVILLE DID NOT FORBID THIS

lbi-3528-168669-0130 I WILL MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS 
lbi-3538-142836-0000 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON CRUISERS CONFECTIONERY ICES AND DESSERT DISHES 
lbi-3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN 
lbi-3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON YIELDED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES 
lbi-3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH PROPERLY ACQUIRED VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE 
lbi-3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP A FINGER INTO THE SURF AND PLUCKED THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF A SOW WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAT WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS MISSES THE LITTLE THREAD 
lbi-3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVED CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN 
lbi-3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKING UP A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL 
lbi-3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS ALWAYS HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUCCESS HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE 
lbi-3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN NINETY NINE 
lbi-3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM UP THREE THEY SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE 
lbi-3538-142836-0010 THERE IS ANOTHER FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ASS WHO ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE 
lbi-3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FURS BY SYRUP WILL BE EASILY COMPREHENDED 
lbi-3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SOU AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEIR TURN 
lbi-3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT HAS ALSO THE ORANGE AND LEMON SHIPS ARE PRESERVED 
lbi-3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUITS OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL QUEST 
lbi-3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JIM'S DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THE PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING A POMP OF FRUIT I AM SOMETIMES PARDON THE RINDS OF SUGAR 
lbi-3538-142836-0016 BUT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE 
lbi-3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET ON LEST THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY 
lbi-3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN O EIGHT 
lbi-3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD BUT VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS ARE CALLED CONFESSIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD COMPARE SAY JAMAICA BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CUISINE 
lbi-3538-142836-0020 A THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHE PURCHASED FROM A CONFECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME 
lbi-3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS ARE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESIRES 
lbi-3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL IN CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS 
lbi-3538-142836-0023 ICES 
lbi-3538-142836-0024 AT DESSERT OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH 
lbi-3538-142836-0025 THIS BATTLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN 
lbi-3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING ONLY SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION 
lbi-3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONE TILL THIS TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE 
lbi-3538-163619-0001 AND THE VAGUE AND THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MANSE CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND RUNNING TO GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AN TRY TER HIS OWN GRAD 
lbi-3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE 
lbi-3538-163619-0003 KISS ME GA SENT AHEAD 
lbi-3538-163619-0004 WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL 
lbi-3538-163619-0005 THE YOUTH PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE 
lbi-3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND 
lbi-3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT FOR THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA 
lbi-3538-163619-0008 WHAT DOES MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN 
lbi-3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL RING CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TOO AND HER BRUSH 
lbi-3538-163619-0010 SHE BENT VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT 
lbi-3538-163619-0011 OUT ON THE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT OR THE YOUNG KINGS LIVE ON SAND AND STONES MY BET I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH A COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNKNOWN 
lbi-3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE 
lbi-3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN TO LET THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN 
lbi-3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET ACQUAINTED WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF 
lbi-3538-163622-0000 WILT SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS US THE KING 
lbi-3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH SAW THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WATCH THE FALL FOR HE COULD DO WELL ENOUGH 
lbi-3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCH FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LIGHT CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING 
lbi-3538-163622-0003 YES LAURA HOUSEHOLD THE YOUTH 
lbi-3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN 
lbi-3538-163622-0005 THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER 
lbi-3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE GIRLS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH AUGUSTA AND SHE CALLED TO HIM 
lbi-3538-163622-0007 COME HITHER COME HITHER MY IMMENSE INFINITE LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR 
lbi-3538-163622-0008 DO YOU LIKE THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE HOLES WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG 
lbi-3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVE LONG DAY 
lbi-3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY STILL I WANTED TO SET OUT 
lbi-3538-163622-0011 THE BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND TENDER LAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY 
lbi-3538-163622-0012 OUR MOCKING HIM AN UNCERTAIN PLACE HAD TINGLED 
lbi-3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS FOR TENDER LAD 
lbi-3538-163622-0014 AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY 
lbi-3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL AGAIN NURSE DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW 
lbi-3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS QUITE CERTAIN THE LAD 
lbi-3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKS LIKE A CHUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE 
lbi-3538-163622-0018 SOONER I TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DROP FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE 
lbi-3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHO NOW ARE TO HAVE ONE NOW KICKS TILL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE'S A MIGHTY CHANGE HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US 
lbi-3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL SAID GUSSIE FAME

lbi-3538-163622-0022 NOW THOSE ARE THE FOOL DOES NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW 
lbi-3538-163622-0023 THAT IS A REVERSE TO THE FULL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT 
lbi-3538-163622-0024 I'VE DONE MY BEST REPLIED THE LAD 
lbi-3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHEN MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD 
lbi-3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED 
lbi-3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCH FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED 
lbi-3538-163624-0003 SO ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS AWAY IN THE MORNING AND SHE SAID 
lbi-3538-163624-0004 THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS 
lbi-3538-163624-0005 HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGON SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU'RE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM 
lbi-3538-163624-0006 THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM 
lbi-3538-163624-0007 ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WAR AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM 
lbi-3538-163624-0008 SO REGAN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE 
lbi-3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND AS FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN 
lbi-3538-163624-0010 SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO 
lbi-3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY 
lbi-3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF TIMID CALLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART 
lbi-3538-163624-0013 SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE 
lbi-3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE 
lbi-3538-163624-0015 GUIDE THOU FAFNIR UNLIT THAT DIED 
lbi-3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGAN AND REGAN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFNIR'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT 
lbi-3538-163624-0017 SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNIR ON A STAKE AND ROASTED IT 
lbi-3538-163624-0018 THERE SIGURD ROASTING FAFNIR'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN WISDOM 
lbi-3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THAT RIGHT OVER HIM FELL TO THE PLACE WHERE BRUNHILDE SLEEPS 
lbi-3538-163624-0020 THE MACHINE SLEEP TILL THE HOUR COMES FOR HER WAKING WHO RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING 
lbi-3538-163624-0021 THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY 
lbi-3538-163624-0022 THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER 
lbi-3538-163624-0023 LIMBER KNEW FATHER TOLD GUNNAR THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THEY RODE AND GUTTERS AT HIS HORSES THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT 
lbi-3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILDE UNGOVERNABLE BATHING BRUNHILDE WADED FARTHER OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS CONSIDERED SUPERIOR 
lbi-3538-163624-0025 FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARE FACE IT 
lbi-3538-163624-0026 NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND NOW WILL NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD 
lbi-367-130732-0000 LOBSTERS AND LOBSTERS 
lbi-367-130732-0001 WHEN IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH 
lbi-367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMER OF INFORMATION PHILOSOPHICALLY SENTENCES GIVEN EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT ABSURD AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH 
lbi-367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH FIRE SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE FLAVOR AS AT ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIA WAS STRENUOUSLY INSISTED IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN 
lbi-367-130732-0004 A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THAT ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN 
lbi-367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY SHAFTS OF WARLIKE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER A LA NEWBURG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THOSE BALDWIN WAS PREPARED IN THE DOMINICA

lbi-367-130732-0012 I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COAST BUT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUS THE PRESENCE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED 
lbi-367-130732-0013 GO BEES PASS WITH THE FIRE IN THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE 
lbi-367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GLORIES OF BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PROCEDURE DID NOT DESCEND TO HER 
lbi-367-130732-0015 GOBY AS CRABS DO 
lbi-367-130732-0016 TAKE THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SKIPPING OUT ALL THE BAD FROM THE SHOW

lbi-367-130732-0021 LOBSTER IN MINIATURE 
lbi-367-130732-0022 SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE WOLF BROW HAS FOR MAKING A SPECIALTY OF THEM 
lbi-367-130732-0023 ALL THE BETTER CLASS RESTAURANTS HOWEVER WILL SERVE THEM IF YOU ORDER THEM 
lbi-367-130732-0024 THIS IS THE RECIPE FOR EIGHT PEOPLE AND IT IS WELL WORTH TRYING FURY GIVING A DINNER OF IMPORTANCE

lbi-4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIETRO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK ON THE PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK 
lbi-4294-14317-0016 AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE NEW SCULPTOR 
lbi-4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY CURTIUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY 
lbi-4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESULT IN HEIGHT I REACHED MY HOME 
lbi-4294-32859-0000 WILDER WAS RATHER SADLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY 
lbi-4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS BLAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED 
lbi-4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIDOLIN AND WATCH HIS PRETTY OUTLINES 
lbi-4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY 
lbi-4294-32859-0004 HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OF A CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLED AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE 
lbi-4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES 
lbi-4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SON WAS LITTLE AND LORNE WHOSE NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR USE NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG 
lbi-4294-35475-0001 THROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE THE STILL UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY STOP AND WAIT WHILE MY BRETHREN 
lbi-4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGHED HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE QUOTED 
lbi-4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THE MAIDEN'S SIGHS ENCOURAGE IT SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM 
lbi-4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING JESTER BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING 
lbi-4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SORT OF EXPLORATION HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRL 
lbi-4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES 
lbi-4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHUTS REND ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE 
lbi-4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL PRAIRIE WITH LILY LEAVES WHICH SHONE LIKE VEINS IN THE MOONLIGHT 
lbi-4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING OF THUNDER TIS THE OLGA CRIED HARRY WE MUST HASTEN 
lbi-4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US FROM THE OGRESS MIGHT 
lbi-4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRESS STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE 
lbi-4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM 
lbi-4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE 
lbi-4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKE DESTROY THE WEB AND GAVE A FLYING TO MEET HIM 
lbi-4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYHOLE 
lbi-4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SATE THE SCISSORS 
lbi-4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH A CHEESE 
lbi-4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE AND CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING 
lbi-4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE ASCRIBE THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLIES SENT ME TO GUIDE YOU TO A PLACE OF SAFETY 
lbi-4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT

lbi-4294-9934-0004 MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT 
lbi-4294-9934-0005 THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM 
lbi-4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HELP THEIR USE IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER 
lbi-4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH WOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THE FATHER 
lbi-4294-9934-0008 HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM

lbi-1998-29454-0030 NOW IS QUEER HE SAID 
lbi-1998-29454-0031 THEY COULD PUT A MAN AWAY FOR LESS THAN THAT 
lbi-1998-29454-0032 I SEE THAT THE BOOKS HAD BEEN CONFIRMED 
lbi-1998-29454-0033 HE REVOLVED THE WAKE THE LAST OF THE ENGLISH AND A BONNET WOULD ASSERT FOR 
lbi-1998-29454-0034 WHITE ONES AND LAUGHED SILENTLY 
lbi-1998-29454-0035 ADVENTURES I SHOULD THINK SO 
lbi-1998-29454-0036 ASKED DICKY UNDERFOOT SILENCE FELL BETWEEN THEM 
lbi-1998-29454-0037 THAT WAS CHARMING BUT IT WAS PLEASANT TOO TO FISH THEM OUT UPON THE WET GRASS 
lbi-1998-29454-0038 THEY KILL US REMEMBER AT THAT MOMENT 
lbi-1998-29454-0039 SO YOU SHALL SAID MISTER VIEW OF REGLA ARE SHOWN OVER THIS VERY NIGHT I ALWAYS LIKE TO WASH MYSELF 
lbi-1998-29454-0040 SOMETIMES THINK IT PAYS TO BE DIRTY BUT IT DON'T 
lbi-1998-29454-0041 IF YOU'LL CLEAN THEY SAY HONEST POVERTY AND IF YOUR DIRTY THEY SAY SERVE YOU RIGHT 
lbi-1998-29454-0042 YOU ARE GOOD SAID DICKIE I DO LIKE YOU 
lbi-1998-29454-0043 I KNOW YOU WILL SAID DICKY WITH ENTHUSIASM I KNOW HOW GOOD YOU ARE 
lbi-1998-29454-0044 BLESS ME SAID MISTER BEALE UNCOMFORTABLY WET 
lbi-1998-29454-0045 ABOUT SEVENTY OR EVEN OF A GOOD THING THIS SIDE OF CHRISTMAS 
lbi-1998-29454-0046 WELL YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT PRESENTLY 
lbi-4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER 
lbi-4350-9170-0001 THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT 
lbi-4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICED THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTEREST OF THE GROUP 
lbi-4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF A SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL EVILS BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE 
lbi-4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES 
lbi-4350-9170-0005 THE BASES OF AUTHORITIES BODILY VIOLENCE 
lbi-4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL 
lbi-4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL OR WOULD COST THE ARMY 
lbi-4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER 
lbi-4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER SECURE 
lbi-4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE 
lbi-4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS OF THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED 
lbi-4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SINGS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSITION IN THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION 
lbi-4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS IN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING 
lbi-4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS SEEMED STILL LESS AN ALLY FOR THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE 
lbi-4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLING AUGUST 
lbi-4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO IS THE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES US 
lbi-4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY 
lbi-4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION DESERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS 
lbi-4350-9170-0019 DUBLIN AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIALS ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT 
lbi-4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP THE FARTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EYES 
lbi-4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIME SUBDUED BY CONQUEST 
lbi-4350-9170-0022 SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
lbi-4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTES THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR SHIPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT 
lbi-4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER BELONG A PINKERTON'S MAN THEY FEEL THIS PURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASE OF THE ARMY 
lbi-4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS IN THE POPE'S ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TODAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTED RECRUITS SAID THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIER THERE STATIONED AND CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS 
lbi-4350-9170-0026 THE MEETING OF THE PREVIOUS SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FATHER NEEDED NOT RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE SLAVE TOILING MASSES 
lbi-4350-9170-0027 AND THE SUB NORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY 
lbi-4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE OF THEIR OTHER GOVERNMENTS ICE PUDDING OR SUCH AS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS SUBJECTS 
lbi-4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BEAUTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOUR BRIGANDS 
lbi-4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASES CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT THAT IN FIFTY YEARS AGO 
lbi-4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENCE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMS 
lbi-4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISMS 
lbi-4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES AND CONSTANTLY INCREASING FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE 
lbi-4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON ALL CITIZENS HAD BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS 
lbi-4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL IN OUR SERVICE 
lbi-4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE THE GROUPS OF PERSONS 
lbi-4350-9170-0037 BOTH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY AND STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID 
lbi-4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS OF THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIKE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBOURS 
lbi-4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORBED THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOUR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND 
lbi-4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENEWS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIGHT VAIN AND FRUITLESS 
lbi-4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS A MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT 
lbi-4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENT ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL EXTERNAL DEFENCE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE 
lbi-4350-9170-0043 THERE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL ACTS OF VIOLENCE OR THE GUN AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN 
lbi-4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT I MAKE HIM 
lbi-4350-9170-0045 I'M EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF A STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY 
lbi-4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY 
lbi-4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THE NUMBER THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT MORAL INFLUENCE 
lbi-4350-9170-0048 SO THAT IS JUSTIFICATION OF THINGS VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN OF A HANDSOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO AS NONE WOULD EVER KNOW 
lbi-4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION 
lbi-4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THIS STATEMENT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM A SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING 
lbi-4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO 
lbi-4350-9170-0052 GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS 
lbi-4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS BE ENSLAVED BY THE NEIGHBORS 
lbi-4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT HOUSE WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES MIGHT ENSLAVE US 
lbi-4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE 
lbi-4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE ARE FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBOR'S EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY THE MUCH GREATER DANGER SUCH ATTACKS 
lbi-4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE 
lbi-4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE 
lbi-4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF A WEALTHY CLASS AND OPPRESSIVE 
lbi-4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF A POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES 
lbi-4852-28311-0000 SAY YOU KNOW SOMETHING 
lbi-4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO ENCOURAGE A GOOD SPARK PLUG 
lbi-4852-28311-0002 NO NEED TO JUMP BACK A F G S 
lbi-4852-28311-0003 OKAY HE SAID 
lbi-4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHY DID YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF 
lbi-4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE OF FLINT A PAPER AND SEND IT SOARING OUT AN EMPTY STREET 
lbi-4852-28311-0006 WELL HE ADMITTED I DIDN'T 
lbi-4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ASKED HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE 
lbi-4852-28311-0008 HE REALLY NEEDS IT IN PURSUIT 
lbi-4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKEY NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WORKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED IN WHOSE STRENGTH WAS NOT WHAT CHRISTENED INTENDED FOR SPENDING THE AFTERNOON 
lbi-4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT MAURICE WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED 
lbi-4852-28311-0011 BETTER GO IN AFTER ALL IS TURNED ON HIM 
lbi-4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE QUARTER 
lbi-4852-28311-0013 AW SHUCKS 
lbi-4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WORKERS HOUSE 
lbi-4852-28311-0015 AND AUNTIE LOT CUTTIN INTO MY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION THE NAIL SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SIR MISTER WORKERS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS 
lbi-4852-28311-0016 NO LONGER WEARING TORN BACK ON A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WAS GONE AND ALLONBY HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BACH SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE 
lbi-4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAIN THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES ENGLISH CLOUDS LOWERED TUMBLED ABOVE 
lbi-4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CRISP DECIDED TO FINISH THE JOB 
lbi-4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM AND PINCHED AND TIGHTEN ITSELF 
lbi-4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL AND REACHED THE HOUSE 
lbi-4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES 
lbi-4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT A COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTRE THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY AND BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN 
lbi-4852-28311-0023 THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES INTO MIRABELLE 
lbi-4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GOING TO MISTER GRIMSHAW NOW HE'S GONE TO BED 
lbi-4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL 
lbi-4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM 
lbi-4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES YOU EXAMINE MISTER WORKERS WHEN NO AND PORED OVER THE ROPE IN A SHIP AND A NUBIAN BOY YOU'D NEVER GONE INTO MISTER KERSHAW KIRK 
lbi-4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM 
lbi-4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH ONE WINDOW AND A LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE A LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBER 
lbi-4852-28312-0003 HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER 
lbi-4852-28312-0004 MISTER WINTERS BACK BEING TOWARDS THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE 
lbi-4852-28312-0005 THE DEVIL FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING THEM I WONDERED A TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD 
lbi-4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FACES ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE FOR THE OLD MAN'S EYES 
lbi-4852-28312-0007 CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE 
lbi-4852-28312-0008 CHRIS SWALLOWED IT HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM 
lbi-4852-28312-0009 YES SIR HE SAID 
lbi-4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDED THE JOB 
lbi-4852-28312-0011 HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE 
lbi-4852-28312-0012 JOE HARRIS'S NAME ISN'T NEW REELING EARS THE JOB 
lbi-4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN 
lbi-4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENT IN IN AN APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES 
lbi-4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND 
lbi-4852-28312-0016 WITH A SUDDEN FEAR WITH SHAKING LEGS GETTING THAN JOHN SIR 
lbi-4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAVE YOU NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CAR WAS MOVING ABOUT ROUND THE CORNER OF WALL STREET NOT THE HILL TOWARD THE LAUGHING SIGNALS 
lbi-4852-28312-0018 THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY STILL 
lbi-4852-28312-0019 THEN IN THAT SECOND SHE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT 
lbi-4852-28312-0020 THE Y BOW WE KNEW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THREE OBJECTS LIKE BEST SHEWING FROSTY MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER 
lbi-4852-28312-0021 CRYSTAL WATER WHERE WAS THE FREEWAY 
lbi-4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKE STACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN 
lbi-4852-28312-0023 THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE 
lbi-4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION 
lbi-4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMP LIT STREETS 
lbi-4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE AND STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOSEVELT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN 
lbi-4852-28312-0027 AND COURTYARD WAS FIERCELY LIT BY FLARING TORTURE TO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST 
lbi-4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF IT WAS NOW BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD 
lbi-4852-28312-0029 THE COACHMAN STOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAND TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAGGED COURTYARD 
lbi-4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE 
lbi-4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS A PATH FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE ABLE TO SEE 
lbi-4852-28319-0000 THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY 
lbi-4852-28319-0001 HE TOLD HIS MASTER IT WAS NOT SIMON GOSLAR HIS HOARD OF MONEY AND AS HIDING PLACES FOR IT 
lbi-4852-28319-0002 CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK 
lbi-4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WINTER'S STUDY HE SAW THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WORK WAS NOT TO BE SEEN 
lbi-4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHALL I DO FIRST 
lbi-4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU'VE IMPROVED MY BOY EXCLAIMED IS NOT A TIME FOR YOU TO TRY MISSUS GULVERT CHANGED ANY 
lbi-4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK 
lbi-4852-28319-0007 MISTER MERWYN IMPATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRISTIE GET UP HIS COURAGE 
lbi-4852-28319-0008 THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER FERGUSON STOPPED AT ONCE 
lbi-4852-28319-0009 THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER 
lbi-4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT MUFFLED SECURITY PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS 
lbi-4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT IN SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WORKERS VOICE BOOMED A SPOT 
lbi-4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR ONE THREE TEN 
lbi-4852-28319-0013 THE FINGERS SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE AT CURRENT APPOINTING TOES 
lbi-4852-28319-0014 THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS 
lbi-4852-28319-0015 IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE 
lbi-4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY FELT CONVINCED AT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL UNHAPPY COMPANION 
lbi-4852-28319-0017 BUT HOW DID ONE AND CHANGE INANIMATE ANIMATE 
lbi-4852-28319-0018 GRACE GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER BERGER'S DOOR 
lbi-4852-28319-0019 HERE THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF INTO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REELING EMPTY WIZARD USE PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD FAR END OF THE ROOM 
lbi-4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON READING BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM 
lbi-4852-28319-0021 THUS GAINED TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLED IN THE SKY 
lbi-4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE MIXED AND POURED THE PROPER TIME 
lbi-4852-28319-0023 MISTER PARKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS BEFORE BOARDS CREAKED CREAKED AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE FUNCTION FUMED AND GLOWED 
lbi-4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY 
lbi-4852-28319-0025 IT WAS AS IF A STIFFNESS MELTED 
lbi-4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES WAS AN OLD OF CLAW BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OVER THE FACE 
lbi-4852-28319-0027 THE WOMAN GRINNED LOOSENED A LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD CASE OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED INTO BOUQUETS FALL 
lbi-4852-28330-0000 THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST 
lbi-4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER PHINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS ADAKAR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL 
lbi-4852-28330-0002 NEXT ENSUING WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY OVER JONESY TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN 
lbi-4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT HAD BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN 
lbi-4852-28330-0004 THE MARABOUT WAS NEARING TEENIE 
lbi-4852-28330-0005 REVOLTER INFESTS TOLD TO GO MAD 
lbi-4852-28330-0006 CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED AND HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN 
lbi-4852-28330-0007 SOFTLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN'S BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING 
lbi-4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINN WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANOPY OVERHEAD AND HERE 
lbi-4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE FROZE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO YOUR DUTY AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD 
lbi-4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING 
lbi-4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO 
lbi-4852-28330-0012 A SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN LIFE OR OF A WHOLE FAMILY 
lbi-4852-28330-0013 HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM 
lbi-4852-28330-0014 WE WILL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND RESPONSIBILITY YOU KNOW 
lbi-4852-28330-0015 THE SHIP AND ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS 
lbi-4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY IT SIR

lbi-5484-24317-0001 BUT HAMILTON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANOR 
lbi-5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR 
lbi-5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITION 
lbi-5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE 
lbi-5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER 
lbi-5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTILUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM 
lbi-5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS ITS OUTS WHICH SATIRIZED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS 
lbi-5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING 
lbi-5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF CONSPIRACY 
lbi-5484-24317-0010 WHEN HAMILTON ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE CHROMATIC MIST IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED 
lbi-5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HER AUNT'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSINOE 
lbi-5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFER TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT AS BLINDNESS TO BURY HIM 
lbi-5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER AT HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELT CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST 
lbi-5484-24317-0014 CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED MIKO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSINOE'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES 
lbi-5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAMES FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY US TO MAKE US THE AGED KING OF THE RACE 
lbi-5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED CLEREMONT INCREDULOUSLY 
lbi-5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES A TIRED WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISE ARTS WHICH GIVE IT THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HARRISON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD 
lbi-5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES I HEAR AMANTES THE LEECH CHRYSIPPUS AND ITS MARBLE PROFITLESS 
lbi-5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISING A FULL LEAVED ONE 
lbi-5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSINOE IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT 
lbi-5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT 
lbi-5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU 
lbi-5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMAN 
lbi-5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSINOE HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND I HAD BEEN MADE INROADS 
lbi-5484-24317-0025 THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT 
lbi-5484-24317-0026 HAMEL LISTENED TO THE PAIR IN SILENCE 
lbi-5484-24317-0027 THE GUARDIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE OUR SNOW ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTOR'S ART WHEN CRAZE HAMMOND'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMETER WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE 
lbi-5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM 
lbi-5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES THEM A TOY EASILY LESSONS DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS 
lbi-5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HAMMOND'S REGARD 
lbi-5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WERE STILL A GENUINE CREATIVE ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT 
lbi-5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION AND SNATCHED ME I CAN PROVE 
lbi-5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER 
lbi-5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES 
lbi-5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN UNPERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS ROUND THEM THEY GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON THE PLACE OF EXECUTION 
lbi-5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK 
lbi-5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DUCHESS ART 
lbi-5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN AND AS A BOON FROM THE IMMORTALS 
lbi-5484-24318-0005 DID I NOT BEAR HIM A HUMILIATION IS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED 
lbi-5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE 
lbi-5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMAN WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AND ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY 
lbi-5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS BREATHLESS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH 
lbi-5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT THE MISSES KNOW THERE WAS A KINDLY DEITY 
lbi-5484-24318-0010 IT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM 
lbi-5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS 
lbi-5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE 
lbi-5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIP IF HER FATHER'S GUESSED WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE 
lbi-5484-24318-0014 CRIED CLEREMONT UNGRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAIL TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE 
lbi-5484-24318-0015 TOMORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH 
lbi-5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIP A SILENCE CHARGED WITH GRAPE EXCLAMATION THE BORDER OF THE KINK 
lbi-5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURNED THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART 
lbi-5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE 
lbi-5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO FIND FOREVER TO HIS WIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT A CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALAESTRA THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILTED LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU 
lbi-5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALWAYS 
lbi-5484-24318-0021 TAFFY EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED 
lbi-5484-24318-0022 BUT HAMILTON WITH SOMETHING HAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW 
lbi-5484-24318-0023 THEN SHE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ACTUAL CENTIMETRES THAT WORK EMERITUS 
lbi-5484-24318-0024 WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU 
lbi-5484-24318-0025 AND I FOOL BLIND ALSO MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT 
lbi-5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MIGHT CONCEAL AND PALLIATE NOTHING 
lbi-5484-24318-0027 SARCASM WAS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIP THAT VERY NIGHT 
lbi-5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY 
lbi-5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY IN HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HAD IT BY AMYNTAS THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROGRESS HOW PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE 
lbi-5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD 
lbi-5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROBBED ALMOST TO BURSTING 
lbi-5484-24318-0032 EVEN AFTER THESE IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM PROCEEDED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND 
lbi-5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS JUST DUE 
lbi-5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN BEY AND HIS MATCH ACROSS THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACH THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FEAST TO PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHEEKS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HAMMON 
lbi-5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SILAS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HAMILTON 
lbi-5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE 
lbi-5484-24318-0037 HONOR TO THE ARTIST AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THIS NOBLE FEAST ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND IN HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY 
lbi-5764-299665-0000 OFTEN WOULD EAT WITH THE BOAST THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMBS AND DOVES AND IN EXCHANGE FOR OR AN ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THESE GUG GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST 
lbi-5764-299665-0001 WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOUR FELLOW THAN MYSELF 
lbi-5764-299665-0002 READING AND PRAYER WAS EVER ONCET 
lbi-5764-299665-0003 WHY YOU DECREED THE INTELLECTUAL INFERIOR 
lbi-5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HAD A PURPOSE WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE 
lbi-5764-299665-0005 ALL THE FAILURES AND THE OBLIGATION TO THE CREATOR 
lbi-5764-299665-0006 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WOLVES THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED 
lbi-5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACK THAT HAD BEEN CAUGHT WITH THE LASH FOR THE BABY TO BE SO FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATE AND DESTROY HIM 
lbi-5764-299665-0008 HE'S GOT RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE THUMB SCREW AND RACK AND FOR OLD INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE 
lbi-5764-299665-0009 THE THIEF GOT THE LOW DECOUD AND VIVE DESTROYED THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS 
lbi-5764-299665-0010 THE HILO TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS 
lbi-5764-299665-0011 CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS 
lbi-5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT THE VOICES OF HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FIERY SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH 
lbi-5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE FEATS ON LIFE 
lbi-5764-299665-0014 THE INFINITE WISDOM EVENTUALLY PROVED THE MICROSCOPY BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NERVE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE 
lbi-5764-299665-0015 FEAR BE SILLY ALL THE BENEFIT OF THE SACRIFICE 
lbi-5764-299665-0016 SOPHIA ERECTS DICK DEAR ROLAND BOWS THE HAND OF MAN IN WORSHIP 
lbi-5764-299665-0017 LOOKS PRETTY WASN'T FEARFU TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM 
lbi-5764-299665-0018 CAN WE SAY THAT IT KEPT FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN 
lbi-5764-299665-0019 CAN WE SAY THAT THIS MERCY AND DREW IT FOREVER 
lbi-5764-299665-0020 DU PUYS GOODNESS BY SHEWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE S AND WALLOWED TOUSAND ALWAYS HEADED WITH CHILDREN ALL THAT WEEK THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WEAK VIVIFIER 
lbi-5764-299665-0021 WELL THANK GOODNESS WAS NO WISDOM IN THIS 
lbi-5764-299665-0022 ALL THE SUPERIOR RACE TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE THE INFERIOR 
lbi-5764-299665-0023 MOST PEOPLE PROBABLY TO THE SUPERNATURAL 
lbi-5764-299665-0024 IF THEY KEEP ONE GOD THE MESSAGE IN ANOTHER 
lbi-5764-299665-0025 WHAT IS THIS POWER 
lbi-5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES THE NECESSARY ADVANCES TO EXPERIENCE 
lbi-5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COME TO EDINBURGH DIVINES 
lbi-5764-299665-0028 HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND NEWS THAT DOES THE WRONG ROAD 
lbi-5764-299665-0029 A CHILD SHOWN BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FADING GRASS DID WITH EASE THE BOAT AGAIN 
lbi-5764-299665-0030 THE POWER THAT WORKS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAD TOLD THE CHILD AND LISTEN 
lbi-5764-299665-0031 IT IS A REVOLT 
lbi-5764-299665-0032 IT IS ASSISTED BY THE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MEN OF DEFOE COLD PHILOSOPHERS THAT IF MORE OFFENSIVE DEFENSIVE DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC 
lbi-5764-299665-0033 WE'VE DIGNITY FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS 
lbi-5764-299665-0034 THEY ALL PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED 
lbi-5764-299665-0035 THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT THESE THREE AS MORAL 
lbi-5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MANNERS 
lbi-5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAD THINNED CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LOVE 
lbi-5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE ADVANCE TO REMOTE CONSEQUENCES I PERCEIVE 
lbi-5764-299665-0039 THE IMAGINATION IS CULTIVATED 
lbi-5764-299665-0040 A MAN BUT HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF ANOTHER 
lbi-5764-299665-0041 THE SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORAL IMPURITY 
lbi-5764-299665-0042 MAN JUDGES HIMSELF 
lbi-5764-299665-0043 IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING BUT THE NATURAL 
lbi-5764-299665-0044 MAN HAS DECEIVED HIMSELF 
lbi-5764-299665-0045 HAS CHRISTIANITY DONE GOOD 
lbi-5764-299665-0046 WHEN THE CHURCH HAD COME THROUGH THE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER 
lbi-5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY AUSTRIA 
lbi-5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN WORSE WITHOUT RELIGION 
lbi-5764-299665-0049 COULD IT HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY 
lbi-5764-299665-0050 WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DID FOLD THEM 
lbi-5764-299665-0051 THEY HATED PLEASURE 
lbi-5764-299665-0052 THEY MUFFLED OLD BASIL DIRECTNESS 
lbi-5764-299665-0053 DURING EACH OF THE PURITAN WILSON AN ADULTERATED CURSE 
lbi-5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEVE THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HAD THE COOL AND RICH 
lbi-5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER TO JUST THE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEVING THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS 
lbi-5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGE IT HERSELF DO DILIGENTLY READ DARING 
lbi-5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS FAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT 
lbi-5764-299665-0058 AS THE BOAT MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KINDNESSES 
lbi-5764-299665-0059 WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN OLD TIMES THIS FANE 
lbi-5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF FINANCE OF INVESTIGATION AND FOOLED 
lbi-5764-299665-0061 HER WEAKNESS NEVER MADE MEN FREE 
lbi-5764-299665-0062 HE HAS NEVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST 
lbi-5764-299665-0063 ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE NEAR VIRTUOUS NEEDED A HONEST THEM SAVAGES 
lbi-5764-299665-0064 CAN WE CURE DISEASE BY FABRICATION 
lbi-5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR ANNA AS ALMS 
lbi-5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THESE MOSS TO RELEASE UNTO PRAYER THAT THIS MOSS TO PUNISH US AND HE RULES THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE 
lbi-5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE COLD STONES 
lbi-5764-299665-0068 DESTRUCTION TO THE BASEMENT 
lbi-5764-299665-0069 IF WE BUILD WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM 
lbi-5764-299665-0070 I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOR ALL THE STONES 
lbi-5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST STONE HE STUCK MATTER SUBSTANCE CAN BE LEASED FOR IT CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED 
lbi-5764-299665-0072 IF THESE COLD STONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FALLS OFF FROM AN ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED 
lbi-5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR 
lbi-5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWS THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE ANY DESIGN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE 
lbi-5764-299665-0075 I SAY WHAT I THINK 
lbi-5764-299665-0076 EVERY EVENT HAS BAIRNS 
lbi-5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HATH NOT HAPPENED COOLNESS 
lbi-5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHAIN DORIS AND THERE CAN BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK 
lbi-5764-299665-0079 WE NOW KNEW THAT O FIERCE BARONS WHO IN THAT FURNACE 
lbi-5764-299665-0080 WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRUDENT YOUTH 
lbi-5764-299665-0081 WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELLED 
lbi-5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEENE CRAZED 
lbi-5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD 
lbi-5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE REFORMS THEORY 
lbi-5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND ON THE LORD'S OWN LUCK AND CHARITY 
lbi-5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VICES TO THE CHILDREN 
lbi-5764-299665-0087 FATE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADE MARK OF NATURE WON 
lbi-5764-299665-0088 THEY HAVE PROVED YOU FIT FOR THE PURPOSE THE FACE WITHOUT INVENTION AND THESE TORIES WE THOU FOLD 
lbi-5764-299665-0089 MISS DE VOE FOREVER REMAINED A VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION 
lbi-5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE BOWED AND UNCONSCIOUS WHY 
lbi-5764-299665-0091 PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEATH 
lbi-5764-299665-0092 LITTLE COMPANY THAT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME 
lbi-5764-299665-0093 THESE CANNOT BE DONE BY TALK OR EXAMPLE 
lbi-5764-299665-0094 THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THE OLD CHRISTIAN 
lbi-5764-299665-0095 THESE FREE WOMEN 
lbi-5764-299665-0096 BAVARIAN GRIME WE BE CHILDLESS 
lbi-5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FOLDS AND BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FAITH IF YOU CHOOSE MINE 
lbi-6070-63485-0000 THEY'RE DONE FOR SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN A LOW KEY TISH WENT OUT WITH THE VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE 
lbi-6070-63485-0001 THE TWO MONSTERS TOOK OFF THE SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSES 
lbi-6070-63485-0002 BY MEANS OF THIS STRATAGEM THEY FOLLOWED SO CLOSELY THAT ALTHOUGH WITHIN A FEW STEPS OF SALMON COME THEY DID NOT HEAR THEM 
lbi-6070-63485-0003 SARAH AND HER BROTHER HAVING AGAIN PASSED BY BUT TO BE FRANK ARRIVED CLOSE TO THE DILAPIDATED HOUSE WHICH WAS PUTTING VILLEINS AND ITS OPEN CELLARS FORMED A KIND OF GULF AND ON WHICH THE STREET RAN IN THAT DIRECTION 
lbi-6070-63485-0004 IN AN INSTANT THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH A LEAP RESEMBLING IN STRENGTH AND AGILITY THE SPRING OF A TIGER SEIZED SEATON WITH ONE HAND BY THE THROAT AND EXCLAIMED YOUR MONEY OR I WILL FLING YOU INTO HIS HOLE 
lbi-6070-63485-0005 NO SAID THE OLD BRUTE GRUMBLINGLY NO NOT ONE THING WHAT A SHAME 
lbi-6070-63485-0006 TUM SEATON DID NOT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND DURING THIS SCENE RAPIDLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AS IT HAD OCCURRED

lbi-6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC 
lbi-6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH COMBINATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANYONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY 
lbi-6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED HAD LOST US LOSE THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS BUT HELEN HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUEL DUTIES 
lbi-6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SOON TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO SURROUNDED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALLOTTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART

lbi-2033-164915-0017 AND AMONGST THEM WERE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE CADET THOU ALMA CAN FORETELL WHAT DAY HIS NAME BE LIGHT OF THE PLACE AND HE HATH A SISTER NEWS HOT AMMAN HIES THE DELIGHT OF THE TIME BUT THEY SAT OUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOR ALL HE WAS A NON WOTTETH WHAT IS BECOME OF THEM 
lbi-6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED A LUCKLESS TRAUE NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK 
lbi-6432-63723-0001 AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP NOW LIMP FASHION TO THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW 
lbi-6432-63723-0002 THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENNETH 
lbi-6432-63723-0003 NO I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT 
lbi-6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR TODAY 
lbi-6432-63723-0005 WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN 
lbi-6432-63723-0006 IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER TO THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM 
lbi-6432-63723-0007 IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SHORE 
lbi-6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN A LARGE STRUCTURE THAT THE WORST PHYSICAL ABUSE DO AS THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID 
lbi-6432-63723-0009 THE COUNT DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM 
lbi-6432-63723-0010 AND GRAFTON STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED 
lbi-6432-63723-0011 HE REMEMBERED THAT ANTHY AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER 
lbi-6432-63723-0012 SHE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER 
lbi-6432-63723-0013 BECAUSE LARGE MADE NO DEFENCE 
lbi-6432-63723-0014 LIKE BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION 
lbi-6432-63723-0015 SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DO NOT ASK OR FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL ME 
lbi-6432-63723-0016 NOW BUT HE WILL OR ELSE SULAMITH GOOD JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT 
lbi-6432-63723-0017 AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP 
lbi-6432-63723-0018 STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW 
lbi-6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELLER WAS TRIED 
lbi-6432-63723-0020 IT HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK 
lbi-6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVEREND THE CONVENTION ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALLROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WRIGGLE A SCENE IN THE DINING ROOM OR CAFE 
lbi-6432-63723-0022 LOCKE HIMSELF HAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER 
lbi-6432-63723-0023 IN A SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOONKEEPER 
lbi-6432-63723-0024 AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH OVER SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA REDFORD HAD MARRIED 
lbi-6432-63723-0025 TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED MY NAME 
lbi-6432-63723-0026 AND IN A WAY WAS TRUE 
lbi-6432-63723-0027 SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGE 
lbi-6432-63723-0028 AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARGE HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS 
lbi-6432-63723-0029 THERE WAS A SET OF LARGE THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY AND HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS A RAWNESS OF THE BIRCH 
lbi-6432-63723-0030 BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SUBMERGED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY UNWILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE 
lbi-6432-63723-0031 IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME IN THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN A CAGE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SHE NE'ER CAN EXPLAIN TO THE COLONEL 
lbi-6432-63723-0032 MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND DO NOT ON DUTY TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SHOT OUR SHE FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER 
lbi-6432-63723-0033 DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT 
lbi-6432-63723-0034 I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM THAT IT WILL TAKE TIME

lbi-6432-63723-0054 YET IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD NO PRIVATE CONVERSATION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER

lbi-6938-70848-0016 MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF DISCHARGES OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING OUR MINDS 
lbi-6938-70848-0017 BY DECLARING THAT SOME OF THE EXTRAORDINARY CONFIDENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO PLUG THE REAL ACTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

lbi-7018-75789-0003 I RIDE MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL 
lbi-7018-75789-0004 AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NOT FROM DIE FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT IN MY TERROR AND CONSENTED FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH 
lbi-7018-75789-0005 WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST AND FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS 
lbi-7018-75789-0006 BUT I WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE RIVER

lbi-7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSULTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT 
lbi-7018-75789-0013 SO I RISE WITHOUT STYLE DELIGHT AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I'VE PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MINE ON LAND

lbi-7018-75789-0019 HE SEEMS TO HAVE SHOWN ME THIS AND AS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF HIS DOMINION THOU HAST TOLD US WHAT THOU HAST WITNESSED 
lbi-7018-75789-0020 PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND ARE DISTRIBUTED PRESENTS AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ALMS AND LODGES AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOINTS AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRY MAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED 
lbi-7018-75789-0021 SUCH THEN MY BROTHERS IS THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL ME IN MY SIXTH VOYAGE AND TOMORROW AY INSHALLAH 
lbi-7018-75789-0022 I WILL TELL YOU THE STORY OF MY SEVENTH AND LAST VOYAGE WHICH IS STILL MORE WONDROUS AND MARVELLOUS THAN THAT OF THE FIRST SIX 
lbi-7018-75789-0023 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT 
lbi-7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT ONCE INVITED THE SEAMEN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WANT 
lbi-7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD THE SAILOR MAN 
lbi-7018-75789-0026 NO OUR COMPANY THAT AFTER MY RETURN FROM MY SIXTH VOYAGE WHICH BROUGHT ME ABUNDANT PROFIT I RESUMED MY FORMER LIFE AND ALL POSSIBLE JOINTS AND ENJOYMENT AND MIRTH AND MAKING MERRY DAY AND NIGHT AND I TARRIED SOME TIME AND THIS SOLACE AND SATISFACTION TO MYSELF BEGAN ONCE MORE TO LONG TO SAIL THE SEAS AND SEE FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND COMPANY WITH MERCHANTS AND MANY THINGS 
lbi-7018-75789-0027 SO HAVING MADE UP MY MIND I PACKED UP IN BALES A QUANTITY OF PRECIOUS STUFFS SUITED FUSSY TRIED AND REPAIRED WITH THEM FROM BAGDAD CITY TO BALSORA TOWN WHERE I FOUND A SHIP READY FOR SEA AND INTO A COMPANY OF CONSIDERABLE MERCHANTS 
lbi-7018-75789-0028 BUT THE CAPTAIN AROSE AND TOTTERED IN HIS GIRDLE TUCKED UP HER SKIRTS AND AFTER TAKING REFUGE WITH ALLAH FROM SIGHT IN THE EAST AND CLIMBED TO THE MASTHEAD WHEN HE LOOKED AT RIGHT AND LEFT AND GAZED AT THE PASSENGERS AND CREW FELL TO BUFFETING HIS VICE AND PLUCKING OUT HIS BEARD 
lbi-7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SAID IN A SOURCE A WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ AWHILE AND SAID WEEPING NOR ARE THE PASSAGES THAT IN THIS BOOK IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT HE SUCCUMBED TO THAT SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT DECISION IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIME OF THE KING WHEREIN IS A SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD SOLOMON SON OF DAVID AN BIMEBY PACE 
lbi-7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH MADE ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NAUGHT MORE MONSTROUS 
lbi-7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT RACE THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA 
lbi-7105-2330-0000 UNFORTUNATELY THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT OR MISCONCEPTION AS TO BEND THEIR BACKS GILT 
lbi-7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THREW OUT A TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER 
lbi-7105-2330-0002 THE JURY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL 
lbi-7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE AND A SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMMEDIATE PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE 
lbi-7105-2330-0004 I HAD NO BURDEN ON THE EVE OF A BYE ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE 
lbi-7105-2330-0005 HENCE THE NECESSITY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DOWNING STREET AND EITHER AFFECTED CENTRES 
lbi-7105-2330-0006 THEY GENERALLY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AND EXCITED MURMUR AND DEATH LIKE HUSH 
lbi-7105-2330-0007 THE FIREMAN DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE 
lbi-7105-2330-0008 THEY GENERALLY FIND THE PRISONER GUILTY OF BLOWING UP THE ALBERT HALL 
lbi-7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISH TO ADD A RIDER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A BY ELECTION ESPECIALLY IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION A NEMESIS ON HAND 
lbi-7105-2330-0010 AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE POLE A JUNIOR CONSUL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY 
lbi-7105-2330-0011 FIFTEEN HUNDRED SAID THE PRIME MINISTER WITH A SHUDDER IT'S TOO HORRIBLE TO THINK OF 
lbi-7105-2330-0012 OUR MAJORITY LAST I WAS ONLY A THOUSAND AND SEVEN 
lbi-7105-2330-0013 SEVEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY 
lbi-7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY THEN SAID THE CHIEF ORGANIZER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING ANOTHER BATH IS OUT BEFORE THE BATTLE OPENS 
lbi-7105-2330-0015 HE SAID IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE OF GETTING A TELEGRAM RED REPS IN TONIGHT 
lbi-7105-2330-0016 DESPITE THE EARLINESS EARLY HOUR A SMALL CROWD HAD GATHERED IN THE STREET OUTSIDE AND THE HORRIBLE MENACING TREE LONE REFRAIN OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED VOTING MEN CAME IN A STEADY MONOTONOUS CHANT 
lbi-7105-2330-0017 HE EXCLAIMED WON'T GO 
lbi-7105-2330-0018 HE SAY ZE NEVER HAS LEFT PRISON WITHOUT A BRASS BAND TO PLAY HIM OUT AND HE'S NOT GOING TO GO WITHOUT ONE NOW 
lbi-7105-2330-0019 SAID A PRIME MINISTER BUT CAN HARDLY BE SUPPOSED TO SUPPLY RELIGIOUS PRISONER WITH A BRASS BAND HOW ON EARTH COULD BE DEFENDED AND ESTIMATES 
lbi-7105-2330-0020 ANYWAY YOU WON'T GO UNLESS HE HAS ABANDONED 
lbi-7105-2330-0021 PAUL OPENS IN FIVE MINUTES 
lbi-7105-2330-0022 IS THERE A BATH OUT YET 
lbi-7105-2330-0023 IN HEAVEN'S NAME WHY 
lbi-7105-2330-0024 THE CHIEF ORGANIZER RANG OFF 
lbi-7105-2330-0025 THIS IS NOT THE MOMENT FOR STANDING ON DIGNITY HE OBSERVED BLANKLY MUSICIANS MUST BE SUPPLIED AT ONCE 
lbi-7105-2330-0026 CAN'T YOU GET US TRY PERMIT AS THE ORGANIZER 
lbi-7105-2330-0027 I'LL TRY SAID THE HOME SECRETARY AND RAN TO THE TELEPHONE 
lbi-7105-2330-0028 EIGHT O'CLOCK STRUCK THE CROWD AS THEY CHANTED IN AN INCREASING VOLUME OF SOUND THE VOTE THE OTHER WAY 
lbi-7105-2330-0029 A TELEGRAM WAS BROUGHT IN 
lbi-7105-2330-0030 AT LAST FROM THIS CENTRAL COMMITTEE ROOM SAID NEMESIS 
lbi-7105-2330-0031 BE THOU THE BAND HE WOULD NOT GO AND THEY HAD NO BAND 
lbi-7105-2330-0032 A QUARTER PAST TEN HALF PAST 
lbi-7105-2330-0033 HAVE YOU AN A BAND INSTRUMENTS OF AN EASY NATURE TO PLAY 
lbi-7105-2330-0034 DEMANDED THE CHIEF ORGANIZER OF THE PRISON GOVERNOR DRUMS CYMBALS THOSE SORT OF THINGS 
lbi-7105-2330-0035 THOUGH OUR TEARS HAVE A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THE MEN THEMSELVES 
lbi-7105-2330-0036 LEND US THE INSTRUMENTS SAID A CHIEF ORGANIZER 
lbi-7105-2330-0037 THE POPULAR SONG OF THE MOMENT REPLIED THE AGITATOR AFTER A MOMENT'S REFLECTION 
lbi-7105-2330-0038 IT WAS A TUNE THEY HAD ALL HEARD HUNDREDS OF TIMES SO THERE WAS NO DIFFICULTY IN TURNING OUT A PASSABLE IMITATION OF IT DID THEY IMPROVISED TRAINS OF I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT THE PRISONER STOOD FORTH TO FREEDOM 
lbi-7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF THE SONG HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THEY INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL 
lbi-7105-2330-0040 THIS HEAT WAS LOST AFTER ALL BY A NARROW MAJORITY 
lbi-7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENCE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THEIR RELEASE AFTHER BATH FAILED TO PACIFY THEM 
lbi-7105-2340-0000 WITH THAT NOTORIOUS FAILING OF HIS HE WAS NOT THE SORT OF PERSON ONE WANTED IN ONE'S HOUSE 
lbi-7105-2340-0001 WELL THE FAMILY STILL EXISTS THE SENATE SAID THE HUSBAND R D SUPPOSE AIRY FORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED A LOW ESTATE

lbi-7105-2340-0005 ALFRED VISION IT HAD COVERED HIMSELF WITH HONORS IN THE COURSE OF MARLBOROUGH'S CAMPAIGNS AND THE NAMELESS WILFRED HAD BEEN AN ABYSMAL WEAKNESS IN THE FAMILY EVER SINCE THE NEW HEIR TO THE FAMILY DIGNITY AND ESTATES WAS A YOUNG MAN OF ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY WHO HAS KNOWN MORE BY REPUTATION THAN BY A PERSON BUT A WIDE CIRCLE OF COUSINS AND KINSFOLK 
lbi-7105-2340-0006 AND THEIR REPUTATION WAS AN IMPRESSIVE ONE 
lbi-7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOLDAYS ONWARDS HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FARM OF KLEPTOMANIA YET THE CUSTOM INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION

lbi-7105-2340-0019 VIGILANCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY CONVEYED A SENSE OF VICTORY

lbi-7105-2340-0021 HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PEG HASN'T BROUGHT US A LESSON AND I'M HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY YOU OFF 
lbi-7105-2340-0022 IT'S THE ONLY THING TO DO 
lbi-7105-2340-0023 LUTHER THUS LATE IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS 
lbi-7105-2340-0024 IT IS AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU 
lbi-7105-2340-0025 IT ASCENDED A PRESENT FROM MY MOTHER AND MYSELF FOR YOUR SILVER WEDDING

lbi-7105-2340-0027 THUS NATURE HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THESE MANY YEARS 
lbi-7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNESTINE PIGEON COTE KISS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH ARE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPRESS OUR AMBITIONS AND THE SUN WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR 
lbi-7105-2340-0029 HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED BLANKLY AND DESPERATELY AT ONE ANOTHER 
lbi-7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE CAME TO THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE'RE AT BREAKFAST 
lbi-7105-2340-0031 SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS TO BE STRIPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS 
lbi-7105-2340-0032 THE PIGEON COTES HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION 
lbi-7105-2340-0033 PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHIN MEASURABLE DISTANCE 
lbi-7105-2340-0034 MISSUS PETER TURNED TO HER GUEST A CONFIDENTIAL KINDNESS 
lbi-7105-2340-0035 HE THREW HIS LITTLE WEAKNESS A TROUNCING TO FAMILY GOOD LORD 
lbi-7105-2340-0036 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE'S A KLEPTOMANIAC THE GLASSES NATUR 
lbi-7105-2340-0037 BRAVE LITTLE WOMAN SAID PETER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT 
lbi-7902-96591-0000 I'M FROM THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST 
lbi-7902-96591-0001 DON'T CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO COME 
lbi-7902-96591-0002 AND AND YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING COME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES 
lbi-7902-96591-0003 I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE 
lbi-7902-96591-0004 THAT MY FATHER SIR IS AN RAM SMUGGLED GOODS HERE 
lbi-7902-96591-0005 HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATED THE SMUGGLERS YOU SHALL NOT TELL 
lbi-7902-96591-0006 PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT OUR JOSEPHINE 
lbi-7902-96591-0007 THEN AS SHE STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HEAR THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT 
lbi-7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION AND MADE IT A MORE IMPROPER AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY AND WHICH OUR CAVALRY STROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS UNBELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK 
lbi-7902-96591-0009 AND NOW COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THE STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD 
lbi-7902-96591-0010 COLOUR CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM 
lbi-7902-96591-0011 I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH 
lbi-7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING 
lbi-7902-96591-0013 NOW HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE IT WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT 
lbi-7902-96591-0014 IF HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER LONG CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD 
lbi-7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT TO SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE 
lbi-7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THE MOST SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SO

lbi-8280-266249-0000 OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE 
lbi-8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR OH BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER 
lbi-8280-266249-0002 THERE ARE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOUR 
lbi-8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER

lbi-8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS 
lbi-8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACT OF TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF A DUCK WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED INTO THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM PRODUCED NAUSEA AND FAINTING 
lbi-8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE TODAY CONTAINS SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IS CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OF TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES 
lbi-8280-266249-0017 IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS INSURERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENTS 
lbi-8280-266249-0018 THAT THE FRENCH POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT IT TO USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS UPON THE MIND 
lbi-8280-266249-0019 NOTICE THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEERS 
lbi-8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN A CIRCUIT OF A MILE ARE DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION 
lbi-8280-266249-0021 AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL AS ITS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT CRINGE

lbi-8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE HOLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE 
lbi-8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALY 
lbi-8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LILBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH AND NOT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL

lbi-8280-266249-0045 THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR 
lbi-8280-266249-0046 MISTER LILBURN MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WORDS INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD

lbi-8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND 
lbi-8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS WITH A FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH

lbi-8461-281231-0034 POOR ISAAC WAS HOUNDED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTOR E ORTIZ ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFICE UNHOOKED AND DISREGARDED 
lbi-8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIENDLY SOULFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE A COTTAGE TO LOOK AROUND AND TO MARCH INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED 
lbi-8461-281231-0036 SHE GAZED ACCORDINGLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO THE HEART THAN HERS 
lbi-8461-281231-0037 AT HIS FEET WAS PLACED THE TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY

lbi-2609-156975-0003 THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THE BONDAGE 
lbi-2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHOSE TEMPERAMENT HAS BEEN FOUND BUNKIE MYRNA PATH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVE REGARDING THE SHOW JOAN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALWAYS IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PITCHER WITH SAKE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIANS FRUITIONS GIVEN PERIOD 
lbi-2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF DETAIL AND REVERENCE FOR THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL 
lbi-2609-156975-0006 IT IS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PARTLY TREASURES ONLY COVERS INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT 
lbi-2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH THEIR TRADITIONAL FONDLY THAT FROME AND MINUTE SAY INCLINE THAT THE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES PROBABLY TOGETHER THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDAH WERE THE CHIEF ACTORS THAT SHALL BLOOM IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY 
lbi-2609-156975-0008 THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVES OF PANTRY DISAGREE REGARDING THE DURATION OF THIS JOURNEY IN EGYPT 
lbi-2609-156975-0009 THE LATER TRADITIONS TO INTEREST IN THAT PERIOD 
lbi-2609-156975-0010 HERE WERE FOUND SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BURNED THE EGYPTIAN NAME OF THE CITY PATTEN HOUSES AROUND ON HIM 
lbi-2609-156975-0011 A CONTEMPORARY INSCRIPTION ON THE STAGE THAT HE FOUND A NEW PIT FROM THE HOUSE OF RAMSAY'S A CITY WITH THE ROYAL RESIDENCE AND TEMPLES 
lbi-2609-156975-0012 THAT THE HEBREWS WERE RESTIVE UNDER THIS JOURNEY WAS NATURALLY INEVITABLE 
lbi-2609-156975-0013 WHERE'S ANY OTHER PROCEDURE TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE DESPOTIC RULER OF THE LAND AND DAY 
lbi-2609-156975-0014 THE MAKING OF THE LOYAL PATRIOT 
lbi-2609-156975-0015 THE STORY OF MOSES BIRTH AND EARLY CHILDHOOD IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHAPTERS IN BIBLICAL HISTORY 
lbi-2609-156975-0016 WHERE'S MOSES JUST FINE AND RUSES AND EGYPTIAN TASKMASTER 
lbi-2609-156975-0017 THIS OPINION IS ALWAYS DISASTROUS NOT ONLY TO ITS VICTIMS OFFERED TO THE GOVERNMENT AND POSTPONEMENT 
lbi-2609-156975-0018 NATURALLY HE WENT TO THE LAND OF MIDIAN 
lbi-2609-156975-0019 THE WILDERNESS TO THE EAST OF EGYPT HAVE FOR CENTURIES BEEN THE PLACE OF REFUGE FOR EGYPTIAN FUGITIVE 
lbi-2609-156975-0020 FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND B C 
lbi-2609-156975-0021 ON THE BORDERS OF THE WILDERNESS THE FASHION BE DON'T HERDSMEN WHO RECEIVED HIM HOSPITABLY 
lbi-2609-156975-0022 THESE SAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TRIBE TO TRIBE UNTIL IT REACHED THE MAN OF JUDAH INTO THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF 
lbi-2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS AND CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND RETURN IN TIME AND PROSPEROUS LOCAL PATRONAGE 
lbi-2609-156975-0024 THE SCHOOL OF THE WILDERNESS 
lbi-2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT OF HUMAN WIT 
lbi-2609-156975-0026 THE BREEZE THAT SUB TRIBE OF THE CHURCH RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE 
lbi-2609-156975-0027 NOTE THEY CHARACTERISTIC ORIENTAL AND OF MARES 
lbi-2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARNED THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS A LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE 
lbi-2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN KNOWS THEM WENT UP WITH A SUDDEN TRAMP SCHUCHARDT KERSHAW'S AND PALMERSTON 
lbi-2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAWING THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THAT CANNOT SENT MOSES FIRST LEARN OF YOUR WAY OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GOD WAS CHIDED BY LATER JEWISH GRIMES JEHOVAH 
lbi-2609-156975-0031 THROUGH THE AREA SABRE TRADITIONS AND IMPLY THAT THE ANCESTORS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPERS OF JEHOVAH 
lbi-2609-156975-0032 THE TOWN OF HIS FATHER IN LAW WAS AN THIS BREACH MINISTERED UNTO HIM WHEN IN SANCTUARY 
lbi-2609-156975-0033 ROSES IN THE HOME OF THE INDIAN VILLAGE WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT AND CONSTANT CONTACT WITH JEHOVAH WORSHIP 
lbi-2609-156975-0034 THEIR CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING 
lbi-2609-156975-0035 THIS FRESH FISH FOR A JUDGE FROM YON ABLE TO DELIVER THE PRISONERS 
lbi-2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENS THE SENSE OF NEED NO DEPENDENCE UPON A POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN 
lbi-2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VATS IN TONE OF CENTRAL ASIA MINOR SHO CAW OF RELIANCE GIVEN SPRING GONE HAVE GIVEN

lbi-3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND A HUMOR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAL LOVELY 
lbi-3080-5032-0003 WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THE NAMES AND A GARDEN 
lbi-3080-5032-0004 WELL THE BEST ON'T IS I HAVE A SQUAW IN A THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT 
lbi-3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND A PRINCE SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH ESTRANGES 
lbi-3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WELL BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD TWO THIRDS GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITH A BOW AND ALL THE KINDNESSES DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE 
lbi-3080-5032-0007 MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AND UNDERSTANDING INDISCRETION OF THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS 
lbi-3080-5032-0008 SINCE A STRANGE CHANGE AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT 
lbi-3080-5032-0009 A STIFFISH AS A SQUIRE OF DAMES AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES AND EVERYBODY MAY PRETEND TO SHED ON HIM AND HE BELIEVED THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE HIS NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES IN THE COURT ROOM AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN A COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT USE IT OFTEN 
lbi-3080-5032-0010 I THINK MY YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH HIM 
lbi-3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUT THEY LAUGH BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDING TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE 
lbi-3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BENUMBING KNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THAT IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE 
lbi-3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FORFEITS AND FIVE HUNDRED FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME 
lbi-3080-5032-0014 BUT BESIDES I CAN GIVE YOU OTHERS 
lbi-3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH LONGER OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN THE ARTS AND SUCH AS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE LIEUTENANT DICK GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM 
lbi-3080-5032-0016 YOU WILL THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS 
lbi-3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES KNOW BETTAH WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT IS WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY ESCAPE IT 
lbi-3080-5032-0018 WELL AN HONEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADIES SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO ROOM TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING A HUT TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE IT'LL FALL SO SAYING JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THE DIFFERENT HUMANS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITH OR WITHOUT ENVYING THE NEIGHBORS 
lbi-3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREEDY FOR I CONFESS I TOO NATURALLY HATE THE NORNS AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN IT ON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WINNERS 
lbi-3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WILL FIT FOR YOU HE SHOULD HAVE DONE 
lbi-3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD 
lbi-3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS YET MOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER 
lbi-3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE BUT MUCH MORE CALMLY 
lbi-3080-5032-0024 AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE ARE SO WAS INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARNED IT SINCE 
lbi-3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM CHEEK MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETER'S 
lbi-3080-5032-0026 HOW CLEARLY DO I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHER'S IN EARNEST YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LET'S APPEASE ME 
lbi-3080-5040-0000 WOULD IT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT 
lbi-3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOUR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HAD GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT 
lbi-3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SEE FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMAGE 
lbi-3080-5040-0003 I WONDER HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
