lbi-1089-134686-0000 HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE STEW FOR DINNER TURNIPS AND CARROTS AND BRUISED POTATOES AND FAT MUTTON PIECES TO BE LADLED OUT IN THICK PEPPERED FLOWER FATTENS SAUCE 
lbi-1089-134686-0001 STUFF IT INTO HIS BELLY COUNSELLED HIM 
lbi-1089-134686-0002 AFTER EARLY NIGHTFALL THE YELLOW LAMPS WOULD LIGHT UP HERE AND THERE THE SQUALID QUARTER OF THE BROTHELS 
lbi-1089-134686-0003 OH BERTIE ANY GOOD IN YOUR MIND 
lbi-1089-134686-0004 NUMBER TEN FRESH NELLY IS WAITING ON YOU GOODNIGHT HUSBAND 
lbi-1089-134686-0005 THE MUSIC CAME NEARER AND HE RECALLED THE WORDS THE WORDS OF SHELLEY'S FRAGMENT UPON THE MOON WANDERING COMPANIONLESS PALE FOR WEARINESS 
lbi-1089-134686-0006 THE DULL LIGHT FELL MORE FAINTLY UPON THE PAGE WHEREON ANOTHER EQUATION BEGAN TO UNFOLD ITSELF SLOWLY AND TO SPREAD ABROAD ITS WIDENING TAIL 
lbi-1089-134686-0007 A COLD LUCID INDIFFERENCE REIGNED IN HIS SOUL 
lbi-1089-134686-0008 THE CHAOS IN WHICH HIS ARDOR EXTINGUISHED ITSELF WAS A COLD INDIFFERENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIMSELF 
lbi-1089-134686-0009 AT MOST BY AN ALMS GIVEN TO A BEGGAR WHOSE BLESSING HE FLED FROM HE MIGHT HOPE WE'RE LIKELY TO WIN FOR HIMSELF SOME MEASURE OF ACTUAL GRACE 
lbi-1089-134686-0010 WELL NOW ENNIS I DECLARE YOU HAVE A HEAD AND SO HAS MY STICK 
lbi-1089-134686-0011 ON SATURDAY MORNINGS WHEN THEY SO DELICATE HE MET IN THE CHAPEL TO RECITE THE LITTLE OFFICE HIS PLACE WAS A CUSHIONED KNEELING DESK AT THE RIGHT OF THE ALTAR FROM WHICH HE LED HIS WING OF BOYS THROUGH THE RESPONSES 
lbi-1089-134686-0012 HER EYES SEEMED TO REGARD HIM WITH MILD PITY HER HOLINESS A STRANGE LIGHT GLOWING FAINTLY UPON HER FRAIL FLESH DID NOT HUMILIATE THE SINNER WHO APPROACHED HER 
lbi-1089-134686-0013 IF EVER HE WAS IMPELLED TO CAST SIN FROM HIM AND TO REPENT THE IMPULSE THAT MOVED HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER KNIGHT 
lbi-1089-134686-0014 HE TRIED TO THINK HOW IT COULD BE 
lbi-1089-134686-0015 BUT THE DUSK DEEPENING IN THE SCHOOLROOM COVERED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RANG 
lbi-1089-134686-0016 THEN YOU CAN ASK HIM QUESTIONS ON THE CATECHISM DAEDALUS 
lbi-1089-134686-0017 STEPHEN LEANING BACK AND DRAWING IDLY ON HIS SCRIBBLER LISTENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HERON CHECKED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING 
lbi-1089-134686-0018 IT WAS STRANGE TOO THAT HE FOUND AN ARID PLEASURE IN FOLLOWING UP TO THE END THE RIGID LINES OF THE DOCTRINES OF THE CHURCH AND PENETRATING INTO OBSCURE SILENCES ONLY TO HEAR AND FEEL THE MORE DEEPLY HIS OWN CONDEMNATION 
lbi-1089-134686-0019 THE SENTENCE OF SAINT JAMES WHICH SAYS THAT HE WHO OFFENDS AGAINST ONE COMMANDMENT BECOMES GUILTY OF ALL HAD SEEMED TO HIM FIRST A SWOLLEN PHRASE UNTIL HE HAD BEGUN TO GROPE IN THE DARKNESS OF HIS OWN STATE 
lbi-1089-134686-0020 IF A MAN HAD STOLEN A POUND IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD USED THAT POUND TO AMASS A HUGE FORTUNE HOW MUCH WAS HE OBLIGED TO GIVE BACK THE POUND HE HAD STOLEN ONLY OR THE POUND TOGETHER WITH THE COMPOUND INTEREST ACCRUING UPON IT ARE ALL HIS HUGE FORTUNE 
lbi-1089-134686-0021 IF A LAYMAN IN GIVING BAPTISM POUR THE WATER BEFORE SAYING THE WORDS IS THE CHILD BAPTIZED 
lbi-1089-134686-0022 HOW COMES IT THAT WHILE THE FIRST BEE ATTITUDE PROMISES THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN TO THE POOR OF HEART THE SECOND BE ATTITUDE PROMISES ALSO TO THE MEEK THAT THEY SHALL POSSESS THE LAND 
lbi-1089-134686-0023 WHY WAS THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST INSTITUTED UNDER THE TWO SPECIES OF BREAD AND WINE IF JESUS CHRIST BE PRESENT BODY AND BLOOD SOUL AND DIVINITY IN THE BREAD ALONE AND IN THE WINE ALONE 
lbi-1089-134686-0024 IF THE WIND CHANGED INTO VINEGAR AND THE HOST CRUMBLE INTO CORRUPTION AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONSECRATED IS JESUS CHRIST STILL PRESENT UNDER THEIR SPECIES AS GOD AND AS MAN 
lbi-1089-134686-0025 A GENTLE KICK FROM THE TALL BOY IN THE BENCH BEHIND URGED STEPHEN TO ASK A DIFFICULT QUESTION 
lbi-1089-134686-0026 THE RECTOR DID NOT ASK FOR A CATECHISM TO HEAR THE LESSON FROM 
lbi-1089-134686-0027 HE CLASPED HIS HANDS ON THE DESK AND SAID 
lbi-1089-134686-0028 THEIR RETREAT WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN HONOR OF SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER WHOSE FEAST DAY IS SATURDAY 
lbi-1089-134686-0029 ON FRIDAY CONFESSION WILL BE HEARD ALL THE AFTERNOON AFTER BEADS 
lbi-1089-134686-0030 BEWARE OF MAKING THAT MISTAKE 
lbi-1089-134686-0031 STEPHEN'S HEART BEGAN SLOWLY TO FOLD AND FADE WITH FEAR LIKE A WITHERING FLOWER 
lbi-1089-134686-0032 HE IS CALLED AS YOU KNOW THE APOSTLE OF THE INDIES 
lbi-1089-134686-0033 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER 
lbi-1089-134686-0034 THE RECTOR PAUSED AND THEN SHAKING HIS CLASPED HANDS BEFORE HIM WENT ON 
lbi-1089-134686-0035 HE HAD THE FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVES MOUNTAINS 
lbi-1089-134686-0036 A GREAT SAINT SAINT FRANCIS XAVIER 
lbi-1089-134686-0037 IN THE SILENCE THERE DARK FIRE KINDLED THE DUSK INTO A TAWNY GLOW 
lbi-1089-134691-0000 HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER 
lbi-1089-134691-0001 FOR A FULL HOUR HE HAD PACED UP AND DOWN WAITING BUT HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER 
lbi-1089-134691-0002 HE SET OFF ABRUPTLY FOR THE BULL WALKING RAPIDLY LEST HIS FATHER SHRILL WHISTLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HAD ROUNDED THE CURVE AT THE POLICE BARRACK AND WAS SAFE 
lbi-1089-134691-0003 THE UNIVERSITY 
lbi-1089-134691-0004 PRIDE AFTER SATISFACTION UPLIFTED HIM LIKE LONG SLOW WAVES 
lbi-1089-134691-0005 WHOSE FEET ARE AS THE FEET OF HEARTS AND UNDERNEATH THE EVERLASTING ARMS 
lbi-1089-134691-0006 THE PRIDE OF THAT DIM IMAGE BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE DIGNITY OF THE OFFICE HE HAD REFUSED 
lbi-1089-134691-0007 SOON THE WHOLE BRIDGE WAS TREMBLING AND RESOUNDING 
lbi-1089-134691-0008 THE UNCOUTH FACES PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO STAINED YELLOW OR RED OR LIVID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STROVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EASE AND INDIFFERENCE A FAINT STAIN OF PERSONAL SHAME AND COMMISERATION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE 
lbi-1089-134691-0009 ANGRY WITH HIMSELF HE TRIED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM THEIR EYES BY GAZING DOWN SIDEWAYS INTO THE SHALLOW SWIRLING WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE BUT HE STILL SAW THE REFLECTION THEREIN OF THEIR TOP HEAVY SILK HATS AND HUMBLE TAPE LIKE COLORS AND LOOSELY HANGING CLERICAL CLOTHES BROTHER HICKEY 
lbi-1089-134691-0010 BROTHER MC ARDLE BROTHER CHIOFF 
lbi-1089-134691-0011 THEIR PIETY WOULD BE LIKE THEIR NAMES LIKE THEIR FACES LIKE THEIR CLOTHES AND IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT THEIR HUMBLE AND CONTRITE HEARTS IT MIGHT BE PAID A FAR RICHER TRIBUTE OF DEVOTION THAN HIS HAD EVER BEEN A GIFT TENFOLD MORE ACCEPTABLE THAN HIS ELABORATE ADORATION 
lbi-1089-134691-0012 IT WAS IDLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENEROUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR GATES STRIPPED OF HIS PRIDE BEATEN AND IN BEGGAR'S WEEDS THAT THEY WOULD BE GENEROUS TOWARDS HIM LOVING HIM AS THEMSELVES 
lbi-1089-134691-0013 IDLE AND EMBITTERING FINALLY TO ARGUE AGAINST HIS OWN DISPASSIONATE CERTITUDE THAT THE COMMANDMENT OF LOVE BADE US NOT TO LOVE OUR NEIGHBOR AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT AND INTENSITY OF LOVE BUT TO LOVE HIM AS OURSELVES WITH THE SAME KIND OF LOVE 
lbi-1089-134691-0014 THE PHRASE AND THE DAY AND THE SCENE HARMONIZED IN ACCORD 
lbi-1089-134691-0015 WORDS WAS IT THEIR COLORS 
lbi-1089-134691-0016 THEY WERE VOYAGING ACROSS THE DESERTS OF THE SKY A HOST OF NOMADS ON THE MARCH VOYAGING A HIGH OVER IRELAND WESTWARD BOUND 
lbi-1089-134691-0017 THE EUROPE THEY HAD COME FROM LAY OUT THERE BEYOND THE IRISH SEA EUROPE OF STRANGE TONGUES AND VALLEY AND WOOD BIGGER DUNCE CITADEL AND OFTEN TRENCHED AND MARSHALLED RACES 
lbi-1089-134691-0018 AGAIN AND AGAIN 
lbi-1089-134691-0019 A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALLING 
lbi-1089-134691-0020 HELLO STEPHANOTIS HERE COMES THE DAEDALUS 
lbi-1089-134691-0021 THEY'RE DIVING STONE POISED ON ITS RUDE SUPPORTS AND ROCKING UNDER THEIR PLUNGES AND THE ROUGH HEWN STONES OF THE SLOPING BREAKWATER OVER WHICH THEY SCRAMBLED IN THEIR HORSEPLAY GLEAMED WITH COLD WITH LUSTRE 
lbi-1089-134691-0022 HE STOOD STILL IN DEFERENCE TO THEIR CALLS AND PARRIED THEIR BANTER WITH EASY WORDS 
lbi-1089-134691-0023 IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SWORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGNS OF ADOLESCENCE THAT MADE REPELLENT THEIR PITIABLE NAKEDNESS 
lbi-1089-134691-0024 STEPHANOTIS DAEDALUS 
lbi-1089-134691-0025 A MOMENT BEFORE THE GHOST OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF THE DANES HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VESTURE OF THE HAZE WRAPT CITY 
lbi-2300-131720-0000 THE PERISHED PLANT LIKE THAT OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE WAS A TEMPORARY EXHIBIT 
lbi-2300-131720-0001 THE LONDON PLANT WAS LESS TEMPORARY BUT NOT PERMANENT SUPPLYING BEFORE IT WAS TORN OUT NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND LAMPS IN HOTELS CHURCHES STORES AND DWELLINGS IN THE VICINITY OF HOLBORN VIADUCT 
lbi-2300-131720-0002 THERE MESSRS JOHNSON AND HAMMER ARE PUT INTO PRACTICE MANY OF THE IDEAS NOW STANDARD IN THE ART AND SECURED MUCH USEFUL DATA FOR THE WORK IN NEW YORK OF WHICH THIS STORY HAS JUST BEEN TOLD 
lbi-2300-131720-0003 THE DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINE THOUGH SMALL WAS ROBUST FOR UNDER ALL THE VARYING SPEEDS OF WATER POWER AND THE VICISSITUDES OF THE PLANT TO WHICH IT BELONGED IT CONTINUED IN ACTIVE USE UNTIL EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE SEVENTEEN YEARS 
lbi-2300-131720-0004 OWING TO HIS INSISTENCE ON LOW PRESSURE DIRECT CURRENT FOR USE IN DENSELY POPULATED DISTRICTS AS THE ONLY SAFE AND TRULY UNIVERSAL PROFITABLE WAY OF DELIVERING ELECTRICAL ENERGY TO THE CONSUMERS ADDISON HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SPOKEN OF AS AN OPPONENT OF THE ALTERNATING CURRENT 
lbi-2300-131720-0005 WHY IF WE ERECT A STATION AT THE FALLS IT IS A GREAT ECONOMY TO GET IT UP TO THE CITY 
lbi-2300-131720-0006 THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT IT WILL CHANGE 
lbi-2300-131720-0007 BROAD AS THE PRAIRIES AND FREE IN THOUGHT AS THE WINDS THAT SWEPT THEM HE IS IDIOSYNCRATIC CLAY OPPOSED TO LOOSEN WASTEFUL METHODS TO PLANS OF EMPIRE THAT NEGLECT THE POOR AT THE GATE 
lbi-2300-131720-0008 EVERYTHING HE HAS DONE HAS BEEN AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION OF ENERGY THE CONTRACTION OF SPACE THE INTENSIFICATION OF CULTURE 
lbi-2300-131720-0009 FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FEASIBLE TO OPERATE MOTORS ON ALTERNATING CURRENTS CIRCUITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN URGED AGAINST IT SERIOUSLY 
lbi-2300-131720-0010 IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELECTRO PLATING OR DEPOSITION NOR COULD IT CHARGE STORAGE BATTERIES ALL OF WHICH ARE EASILY WITHIN THE ABILITY OF THE DIRECT CURRENT 
lbi-2300-131720-0011 BUT WHEN IT CAME TO BE A QUESTION OF LIGHTING A SCATTERED SUBURB A GROUP OF DWELLINGS ON THE OUTSKIRTS ARE REMOTE COUNTRY RESIDENCE OR AFAR MOWS THE ALTERNATING CURRENT IN ALL ELEMENTS SAVE ITS DANGER WAS AND IS IDEAL 
lbi-2300-131720-0012 ADDISON WAS INTOLERANT OF SHAM AND SHODDY AND NOTHING WOULD SATISFY HIM THAT COULD NOT STAND CROSS EXAMINATION BY MICROSCOPE TEST TUBE AND GALVANOMETER 
lbi-2300-131720-0013 UNLESS HE COULD SECURE AN ENGINE OF SMOOTH RUNNING AND MORE EXACTLY GOVERNED AND REGULATED THAN THOSE AVAILABLE FOR HIS DYNAMO AND LAMP ADDISON REALIZED THAT HE WOULD FIND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A STEADY LIGHT 
lbi-2300-131720-0014 MISTER ADDISON WAS A LEADER FAR AHEAD OF THE TIME 
lbi-2300-131720-0015 HE OBTAINED THE DESIRED SPEED AND LOAD WITH THE FRICTION BRAKE ALSO REGULATOR OF SPEED BUT WAITED FOR AN INDICATOR TO VERIFY IT 
lbi-2300-131720-0016 THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LUBRICATE AN ENGINE FOR CONTINUOUS RUNNING AND MISTER ADDISON INFORMED ME THAT AS A MARINE ENGINE STARTED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW YORK AND CONTINUED RUNNING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENGINE FOR HIS PURPOSES MUST PRODUCE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES 
lbi-2300-131720-0017 ADDISON HAD INSTALLED HIS HISTORIC FIRST GREAT CENTRAL STATION SYSTEM IN NEW YORK ON THE MULTIPLE ARC SYSTEM COVERED BY HIS FEEDER AND MAIN INVENTION WHICH RESULTED IN A NOTABLE SAVING IN THE COST OF CONDUCTORS AS AGAINST A STRAIGHT TO WIRE SYSTEM THREW OUT OF THE TREE KIND 
lbi-2300-131720-0018 HE SOON FORESAW THAT STILL GREATER ECONOMY WOULD BE NECESSARY FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS NOT ALONE FOR THE LARGER TERRITORY OPENING BUT FOR THE COMPACT DISTRICT OF LARGE CITIES 
lbi-2300-131720-0019 THE STRONG POSITION HELD BY THE MEDICINE SYSTEM UNDER THE STRENUOUS COMPETITION THAT WAS ALREADY SPRINGING UP WAS ENORMOUSLY IMPROVED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF A THREE WIRE SYSTEM AND IT GAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPETUS TO INCANDESCENT LIGHTING 
lbi-2300-131720-0020 IT WAS SPECIALLY SUITED FOR A TRIAL PLAID ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A CHILD OF SIX OR EIGHT LAMPS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDERED A SUBJECT FOR CONGRATULATION 
lbi-2300-131720-0021 THE STREET CONDUCTORS WERE OF THE OVERHEAD FULL LINE CONSTRUCTION AND WERE INSTALLED BY THE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT HAD BEEN ORGANIZED BY ADDISON TO BUILD AND EQUIP CENTRAL STATIONS 
lbi-2300-131720-0022 MEANWHILE HE HAD CALLED UPON ME TO MAKE A REPORT OF THE THREE R SYSTEM KNOWN IN ENGLAND AS THE HOPKINSON BOTH DOCTOR JOHN HOPKINSON AND MISTER ADDISON BEING INDEPENDENT INVENTORS AT PRACTICALLY THE SAME TIME 
lbi-2300-131720-0023 I THINK HE WAS PERHAPS MORE APPRECIATIVE THAN I WAS OF THE DISCIPLINE OF THE ADDISON CONSTRUCTION TO BURN AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WELL FOR US TO WAIT UNTIL THE MORNING OF THE FOURTH BEFORE WE STARTED UP 
lbi-2300-131720-0024 BUT THE PLANT RAN AND IT WAS THE FIRST THREE WIRE STATION IN THIS COUNTRY 
lbi-2300-131720-0025 THEY WERE LATER USED AS RESERVE MACHINES AND FINALLY WITH THE ENGINE RETIRED FROM SERVICE AS PART OF THE COLLECTION OF M DE SONIA BUT THEY REMAIN IN PRACTICALLY AS GOOD CONDITION AS WHEN INSTALLED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE 
lbi-2300-131720-0026 THE ARC LAMP INSTALLED OUTSIDE A CUSTOMER'S PROMISES OR IN A CIRCUIT FOR PUBLIC STREET LIGHTING BURNED SO MANY HOURS NIGHTLY SO MANY NIGHTS IN THE MONTH AND WAS PAID FOR AT THAT RATE SUBJECT REBATE FOR HOURS WHEN THE LAMP MIGHT BE OUT THROUGH ACCIDENT 
lbi-2300-131720-0027 ADDISON HELD THAT THE ELECTRICITY SOLD MUST BE MEASURED JUST LIKE GAS OR WATER AND HE PROCEEDED TO DEVELOP A METRE 
lbi-2300-131720-0028 THERE WAS INFINITE SKEPTICISM AROUND HIM ON THE SUBJECT AND WHILE OTHER INVENTORS WERE ALSO GIVING THE SUBJECT BEAR THOUGHT THE PUBLIC TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT ANYTHING SO UTTERLY INTANGIBLE AS ELECTRICITY THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN OR WADE AND ONLY GAVE SECONDARY EVIDENCE OF ITSELF AT THE EXACT POINT OF USE COULD NOT BE BROUGHT TO ACCURATE REGISTRATION 
lbi-2300-131720-0029 HENCE THE ADDISON ELECTROLYTIC METRE IS NO LONGER USED DESPITE ITS EXCELLENT QUALITIES 
lbi-2300-131720-0030 THE PRINCIPLE EMPLOYED IN THE ADDISON ELECTROLYTIC METRE IS THAT WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE POWER OF ELECTRICITY TO DECOMPOSE A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE 
lbi-2300-131720-0031 ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SIMPLE FORM OF APPARATUS WERE VARIOUS INGENIOUS DETAILS AND REFINEMENTS TO SECURE REGULARITY OF OPERATION FREEDOM FROM INACCURACY AND IMMUNITY FROM SUCH TAMPERING AS WOULD PERMIT THEFT OF CURRENT OR DAMAGE 
lbi-2300-131720-0032 THE STANDARD ADDISON MEADER PRACTICE WAS TO REMOVE THE CELLS ONCE A MONTH TO THE MEETING ROOM OF THE CENTRAL STATION COMPANY FOR EXAMINATION ANOTHER SET BEING SUBSTITUTED 
lbi-2300-131720-0033 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER W J JENKS READ AN INTERESTING PAPER BEFORE THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS ON THE SIX YEARS OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE HAD UP TO THAT TIME WITH THE METER THEN MORE GENERALLY IN USE THAN ANY OTHER 
lbi-2300-131720-0034 THE OTHERS HAVING BEEN IN OPERATION TOO SHORT A TIME TO SHOW DEFINITE RESULTS ALTHOUGH THEY ALSO WENT QUICKLY TO A DIVIDEND BASIS 
lbi-2300-131720-0035 IN THIS CONNECTION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT THE ASSOCIATION OF ADDISON ILLUMINATING COMPANIES IN THE SAME YEAR ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS UNANIMOUSLY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE OTHER SHOULD MEADER WAS ACCURATE AND THAT ITS USE WAS NOT EXPENSIVE FOR STATIONS ABOVE ONE THOUSAND LIGHTS AND THAT THE BEST FINANCIAL RESULTS WERE INVARIABLY SECURED IN A STATION SHUFFLING CURRENT BY METER 
lbi-2300-131720-0036 THE MEETING CONTINUED AND GENERAL SERVICE DURING EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE AND PROBABLY UP TO THE CLOSE OF THE CENTURY 
lbi-2300-131720-0037 HE WEIGHED AND RE WEIGHED DEMETER PLATES AND PURSUED EVERY LINE OF INVESTIGATION IMAGINABLE BUT ALL IN VAIN 
lbi-2300-131720-0038 HE FELT HE WAS UP AGAINST IT AND THAT PERHAPS ANOTHER KIND OF A JOB WOULD SUIT HIM BETTER 
lbi-2300-131720-0039 THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED 
lbi-2300-131720-0040 WE WERE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNICAL CONDITION OF THE STATION THAN IN THE COMMERCIAL PART 
lbi-2300-131720-0041 WE HAD METRES IN WHICH THERE WERE TWO BOTTLES OF LIQUID 
lbi-237-126133-0000 HERE SHE WOULD STAY COMFORTED AND SOOTHED AMONG THE LOVELY PLANTS AND RICH EXOTICS REJOICING THE HEART OF OLD TURNER THE GARDENER WHO SINCE POLLY'S FIRST RAPTUROUS ENTRANCE HAD TAKEN HER INTO HIS GOOD GRACES FOR ALL TIME 
lbi-237-126133-0001 EVERY CHANCE SHE COULD STEAL AFTER PRACTICE HOURS WERE OVER AND AFTER THE CLAMOROUS DEMANDS OF THE BOYS UPON HER TIME WERE FULLY SATISFIED WAS SEIZED A FLY ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND TO THE FLOWERS 
lbi-237-126133-0002 THEN DEAR SAID MISSUS WHITNEY YOU MUST BE KIND TO HER THAN EVER THINK WHAT IT WOULD BE FOR ONE OF YOU TO BE AWAY FROM HOME EVEN AMONG FRIENDS 
lbi-237-126133-0003 SOMEHOW OF ALL THE DAYS WHEN THE HOME FEELING WAS THE STRONGEST THIS DAY IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER 
lbi-237-126133-0004 IF SHE COULD ONLY SEE FRANZY FOR JUST ONE MOMENT 
lbi-237-126133-0005 OH SHE'S ALWAYS AT THE PIANO SAID VAN SHE MUST BE THERE NOW SOMEWHERE AND THEN SOMEBODY LAUGHED 
lbi-237-126133-0006 AT THIS THE BUNDLE OPEN SUDDENLY AND OUT POPPED BRONZIE 
lbi-237-126133-0007 BUT POLLY COULDN'T SPEAK AND IF JASPER HADN'T CAUGHT HER JUST IN TIME SHE WOULD HAVE TUMBLED OVER BACKWARD FROM A STOOL PHRONSIE AND ALL 
lbi-237-126133-0008 ASKED PHRONSIE WITH HER LITTLE FACE CLOSE TO POLLY'S OWN 
lbi-237-126133-0009 NOW YOU'LL STAY CRIED VAN SAY POLLY WON'T YOU 
lbi-237-126133-0010 OH YOU ARE THE DEAREST AND BEST MISTER KING I EVER SAW BUT HOW DID YOU MAKE MAMMY LET HER COME 
lbi-237-126133-0011 ISN'T HE SPLENDID CRIED JASPER AND INTENSE PRIDE SWELLING UP FATHER KNEW HOW TO DO IT 
lbi-237-126133-0012 THERE THERE HE SAID SOOTHINGLY PATTING HER BROWN FUZZY HEAD 
lbi-237-126133-0013 I KNOW GASPED POLLY CONTROLLING HER SOBS I WON'T ONLY I CAN'T THANK YOU 
lbi-237-126133-0014 ASKED PHRONSIE IN INTENSE INTEREST SLIPPING DOWN OUT OF POLLY'S ARMS AND CROWDING UP CLOSE TO JASPER SIGHED 
lbi-237-126133-0015 YES ALL ALONE BY HIMSELF ASSERTED JASPER VEHEMENTLY UNWINKING FURIOUSLY TO THE OTHERS TO STOP THEIR LAPPING HEEDED NOW TRULY PHRONSIE 
lbi-237-126133-0016 OH NO JAPS OR I MUST GO BY MY VERY OWN SELF 
lbi-237-126133-0017 THEIR JAP YOU'VE CAUGHT IT LAPPED PERCY WHILE THE OTHERS SCREAMED AT THE SIGHT OF JASPER SPACE 
lbi-237-126133-0018 DON'T MIND IT POLLY WHISPERED JASPER IT WASN'T HER FAULT 
lbi-237-126133-0019 DEAR ME EJACULATED THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN THE UTMOST AMAZEMENT AND SUCH A TIME AS I'VE HAD TO GET HER HERE TOO 
lbi-237-126133-0020 HOW DID HER MOTHER EVER LET HER GO 
lbi-237-126133-0021 SHE ASKED IMPULSIVELY I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU COULD PERSUADE HER FATHER 
lbi-237-126133-0022 I DIDN'T HAVE ANY FEARS IF I WORKED AT RIGHTLY SAID THE OLD GENTLEMAN COMPLACENTLY 
lbi-237-126133-0023 HE CRIED IN HIGH DUDGEON JUST AS IF HE OWNED THE WHOLE OF THE PEPPERS AND COULD DISPOSE OF THEM ALL TO SUIT HIS FANCY 
lbi-237-126133-0024 AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH HIS SUCCESS THAT HE HAD TO BURST OUT INTO A SERIES OF SHORT HAPPY BITS OF LAUGHTER THAT OCCUPIED QUITE A SPACE OF TIME 
lbi-237-126133-0025 AT LAST HE CAME OUT OF THEM AND WIPED HIS FACE VIGOROUSLY 
lbi-237-134493-0000 IT IS SIXTEEN YEARS SINCE JOHN BURKE'S AND DIED 
lbi-237-134493-0001 HIS WIFE NOW LIES BESIDE HIM AND THE WHITE SHAFT THAT MARKED THEIR GRAVES GLEAMS ACROSS THE WHEAT FIELDS 
lbi-237-134493-0002 FROM THE NORWEGIAN GRAVEYARD ONE LOOKS OUT OVER A VAST CHECKER BOARD MARKED OFF IN SQUARES OF WHEAT AND CORN LIGHT AND DARK DARK AND LIGHT 
lbi-237-134493-0003 FROM THE GRAVEYARD GATE ONE CAN COUNT A DOZEN GAILY PAINTED FARMHOUSES THE GILDED WEATHER VANE ON THE BIG RED BARNS WINK AT EACH OTHER ACROSS THE GREEN AND BROWN AND YELLOW FIELDS 
lbi-237-134493-0004 THE AIR AND THE EARTH ARE CURIOUSLY MATED AND INTERMINGLED AS IF THE ONE WERE THE BREATH OF THE OTHER 
lbi-237-134493-0005 HE WAS A SPLENDID FIGURE OF A BOY TALL AND STRAIGHT AS A YOUNG PINE TREE WITH A HANDSOME HEAD AND STORMY GREY EYES DEEPLY SET UNDER A SERIOUS BROW 
lbi-237-134493-0006 THAT'S NOT MUCH OF A JOB FOR AN ATHLETE HERE I'VE BEEN TO TOWN AND BACK 
lbi-237-134493-0007 ALEXANDRA THAT YOU SLEEP LATE 
lbi-237-134493-0008 SHE GATHERED UP HER REINS 
lbi-237-134493-0009 PLEASE WAIT FOR ME MARIE EMILE COAXED 
lbi-237-134493-0010 I NEVER SEE LOU'S SIDE OVER HERE 
lbi-237-134493-0011 HOW BROWN YOU'VE GOT SINCE YOU CAME HOME I WISH I HADN'T ACTUALLY TOMORROW MY ORCHARD 
lbi-237-134493-0012 I GET WET TO MY KNEES WHEN I GO DOWN TO PICK CHERRIES 
lbi-237-134493-0013 INDEED HE HAD LOOKED AWAY WITH A PURPOSE OF NOT SEEING IT 
lbi-237-134493-0014 THEY THINK YOU'RE PROUD BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN AWAY TO SCHOOL OR SOMETHING 
lbi-237-134493-0015 THERE WAS SOMETHING INDIVIDUAL ABOUT THE GREAT FARM A MOST UNUSUAL TRIMNESS AND CARE FOR DETAIL 
lbi-237-134493-0016 ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR A MILE BEFORE HE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE HILL STOOD TALL OSAGE ORANGE HEDGES THEIR GLOSSY GREEN MARKING OFF THE YELLOW FIELDS 
lbi-237-134493-0017 ANY ONE THEREABOUTS WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE RICHEST FARMS ON THE DIVIDE AND THAT THE FARMER WAS A WOMAN ALEXANDRA BERGSON 
lbi-237-134493-0018 THERE IS EVEN A WHITE ROW OF BEEHIVES IN THE ORCHARD UNDER THE WALNUT TREES 
lbi-237-134500-0000 FRANK READ ENGLISH ESPECIALLY AND THE MORE HE READ ABOUT THIS DIVORCE CASE THE ANGRIER HE GREW 
lbi-237-134500-0001 MARIE SIGHED 
lbi-237-134500-0002 A BRISK WIND HAD COME UP AND WAS DRIVING PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS ACROSS THE SKY 
lbi-237-134500-0003 THE ORCHARD WAS SPARKLING AND RIPPLING IN THE SUN 
lbi-237-134500-0004 THAT INVITATION DECIDED HER 
lbi-237-134500-0005 OH BUT I'M GLAD TO GET THIS PLACE MODE 
lbi-237-134500-0006 JUST SMELL THE WILD ROSES THEY ARE ALWAYS SO SPICY AFTER A RAIN 
lbi-237-134500-0007 WE NEVER HAD SO MANY OF THEM IN HERE BEFORE 
lbi-237-134500-0008 I SUPPOSE IT'S THE WET SEASON WILL YOU HAVE TO CUT THEM TOO 
lbi-237-134500-0009 I SUPPOSE THAT THE WET SEASON TOO THEN 
lbi-237-134500-0010 IT'S EXCITING TO SEE EVERYTHING GROWING SO FAST AND TO GET THE GRASS CUT 
lbi-237-134500-0011 ARE YOU SPLASHED LOOK AT A SPIDER WEBS ALL OVER THE GRASS 
lbi-237-134500-0012 IN A FEW MOMENTS HE HEARD THE CHERRIES DROPPING SMARTLY INTO THE PAIL AND HE BEGAN TO SWING HIS SIGH WITH THAT LONG EVEN STROKE THAT FEW AMERICAN BOYS EVER LEARN 
lbi-237-134500-0013 LARRY PICKED CHERRIES AND SANG SOFTLY TO HERSELF STRIPPING ONE GLITTERING RANCH AFTER ANOTHER SHIVERING WHEN SHE GOT A SHOWER OF RAINDROPS ON HER NECK AND HAIR 
lbi-237-134500-0014 AND EMILE MOWED HIS WAY SLOWLY DOWN TOWARD THE CHERRY TREES 
lbi-237-134500-0015 THAT SUMMER THE RAINS HAD BEEN SO MANY AND OPPORTUNE THAT IT WAS ALMOST MORE THAN A BATTA AND AS MAN COULD DO TO KEEP UP WITH THE CORN THE ORCHARD WAS A NEGLECTED WILDERNESS 
lbi-237-134500-0016 I DON'T KNOW ALL OF THEM BUT I KNOW THE INDIANS ARE 
lbi-237-134500-0017 IF I FEEL THAT WAY I FEEL THAT WAY 
lbi-237-134500-0018 HE REACHED UP AMONG THE BRANCHES AND BEGAN TO PICK THE SWEET INCIPIT FRUIT LONG IVORY COLOURED BERRIES TIPPED WITH FAINT PINK LIKE WHITE CURL THAT FALL TO THE GROUND UNHEEDED ALL SUMMER THROUGH 
lbi-237-134500-0019 HE DROPPED A HANDFUL INTO HER LAP 
lbi-237-134500-0020 YES DON'T YOU 
lbi-237-134500-0021 OH EVER SO MUCH ONLY HE SEEMS KIND OF STAY AT AND SCHOOL TEACHER E 
lbi-237-134500-0022 WHEN SHE USED TO TELL ME ABOUT HIM I ALWAYS WONDERED WHETHER SHE WASN'T A LITTLE IN LOVE WITH HIM 
lbi-237-134500-0023 IT WOULD SERVE YOU ALL RIGHT IF SHE WALKED OFF WITH CARL 
lbi-237-134500-0024 I LIKE TO TALK TO CARL ABOUT NEW YORK AND WHAT A FELLOW CAN DO THERE 
lbi-237-134500-0025 OH EMILE 
lbi-237-134500-0026 SURELY YOU ARE NOT THINKING OF GOING OFF THERE 
lbi-237-134500-0027 BARRY'S FACE FELL UNDER HIS BROODING GAZE 
lbi-237-134500-0028 I'M SURE ALEXANDER HOPE YOU WILL STAY ON HERE SHE MURMURED 
lbi-237-134500-0029 I DON'T WANT TO STAND AROUND A MUG ON 
lbi-237-134500-0030 I WANT TO BE DOING SOMETHING ON MY OWN ACCOUNT 
lbi-237-134500-0031 SOMETIMES I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL AND SOMETIMES I WANT TO PULL THE FOUR CORNERS OF A DIVIDE TOGETHER HE THREW OUT HIS ARM AND BROUGHT IT BACK WITH A JERK SO LIKE A TABLECLOTH 
lbi-237-134500-0032 I GET TIRED OF SEEING MEN AND HORSES GOING UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN 
lbi-237-134500-0033 I WISH YOU WEREN'T SO RESTLESS AND DIDN'T GET SO WORKED UP OVER THINGS SHE SAID SADLY 
lbi-237-134500-0034 THANK YOU HE RETURNED SHORTLY 
lbi-237-134500-0035 AND YOU NEVER USED TO BE CROSS TO ME 
lbi-237-134500-0036 I CAN'T PLAY WITH YOU LIKE A LITTLE BOY ANY MORE HE SAID SLOWLY THAT'S WHAT YOU MISS MURRAY 
lbi-237-134500-0037 BUT EMILE IF I UNDERSTAND IN OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER WE CAN NEVER DO NICE THINGS TOGETHER ANY MORE 
lbi-237-134500-0038 AND ANYHOW THERE'S NOTHING TO UNDERSTAND 
lbi-237-134500-0039 THAT WON'T LAST IT WILL GO AWAY AND THINGS WILL BE JUST AS THEY USED TO 
lbi-237-134500-0040 I PRAY FOR YOU BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF YOU PRAY YOURSELF 
lbi-237-134500-0041 I CAN'T PRAY TO HAVE THE THINGS I WANT HE SAID SLOWLY AND I WON'T PRAY NOT TO HAVE THEM NOT IF I'M DAMNED FOR IT 
lbi-237-134500-0042 THEN ALL OUR GOOD TIMES ARE OVER 
lbi-260-123286-0000 SATURDAY AUGUST FIFTEENTH THE SEA UNBROKEN ALL ROUND NO LAND IN SIGHT 
lbi-260-123286-0001 THE HORIZON SEEMS EXTREMELY DISTANT 
lbi-260-123286-0002 ALL MY DANGER AND SUFFERINGS WERE NEEDED TO STRIKE A SPARK OF HUMAN FEELING AND OF HIM BUT NOW THAT I AM WELL HIS NATURE HAS RESUMED ITS SWAY 
lbi-260-123286-0003 YOU SEEM ANXIOUS MY UNCLE I SAID SEEING HIM CONTINUALLY WITH HIS GLASS TO HIS EYE ANXIOUS 
lbi-260-123286-0004 ONE MIGHT BE WITH LESS REASON THAN NOW 
lbi-260-123286-0005 I AM NOT COMPLAINING THAT THE RATE IS SLOW BUT THAT THE SEA IS SO WIDE 
lbi-260-123286-0006 WE'RE LOSING TIME AND THE FACT IS I HAVE NOT COME ALL THIS WAY TO TAKE A LITTLE SAIL UPON A POND ON A RAFT 
lbi-260-123286-0007 HE CALLED THE SEA UPON OUR LONG VOYAGE TAKING A LITTLE SAIL 
lbi-260-123286-0008 THEREFORE DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT VIEWS AND PROSPECTS 
lbi-260-123286-0009 I TAKE THIS AS MY ANSWER AND I LEAVE THE PROFESSOR TO BITE HIS LIPS WITH IMPATIENCE 
lbi-260-123286-0010 SUNDAY AUGUST SIXTEENTH 
lbi-260-123286-0011 NOTHING NEW WHETHER UNCHANGED THE WIND FRESHENS 
lbi-260-123286-0012 BUT THERE SEEMED NO REASON TO FEAR 
lbi-260-123286-0013 THE SHADOW OF THE RAT WAS CLEARLY OUTLINED UPON THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES 
lbi-260-123286-0014 TRULY THE SEA IS OF INFINITE WIT 
lbi-260-123286-0015 IT MUST BE AS WIDE AS THE MEDITERRANEAN OR THE ATLANTIC AND WHY NOT 
lbi-260-123286-0016 THESE THOUGHTS AGITATED ME ALL DAY AND MY IMAGINATION SCARCELY CALMED DOWN AFTER SEVERAL HOURS SLEEP 
lbi-260-123286-0017 I SHUDDER AS I RECALL THESE MONSTERS TO MY REMEMBRANCE 
lbi-260-123286-0018 I SAW AT THE HAMBURG MUSEUM THE SKELETON OF ONE OF THESE CREATURES THIRTY FEET IN LENGTH 
lbi-260-123286-0019 I SUPPOSE PROFESSOR LEAD AND ROCK WAS OF MY OPINION TOO AND EVEN SHARED MY FEARS FOR AFTER HAVING EXAMINED THE PICK HIS EYES TRAVERSED THE OCEAN FROM SIDE TO SIDE 
lbi-260-123286-0020 TUESDAY AUGUST EIGHTEENTH 
lbi-260-123286-0021 DURING HIS WATCH I SLEPT 
lbi-260-123286-0022 TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS A TERRIBLE SHOCK AWOKE ME 
lbi-260-123286-0023 THE RAFT WAS HEAVED UP ON A WATERY MOUNTAIN AND PITCH DOWN AGAIN AT A DISTANCE OF TWENTY FATHOMS 
lbi-260-123286-0024 THERE'S A WHALE A WHALE CRIED THE PROFESSOR 
lbi-260-123286-0025 FLIGHT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION NOW THE REPTILE'S ROSE THEY WHEELED AROUND OUR LITTLE RAFT WITH A RAPIDITY GREATER THAN THAT OF EXPRESS TRAINS 
lbi-260-123286-0026 TWO MONSTERS ONLY RECREATING ALL THIS COMMOTION AND BEFORE MY EYES ARE TWO REPTILES OF THE PRIMITIVE WORLD 
lbi-260-123286-0027 I CAN DISTINGUISH THE EYE OF ATHEISTS ORRIS GLOWING LIKE A RED HOT COAL AND AS LARGE AS A MAN'S HEAD 
lbi-260-123286-0028 ITS JAW IS ENORMOUS AND ACCORDING TO NATURALISTS IS ARMED WITH NO LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO TEETH 
lbi-260-123286-0029 THOSE HUGE CREATURES ATTACK EACH OTHER WITH THE GREATEST ANIMOSITY 
lbi-260-123286-0030 SUDDENLY THE IGNEOUS ORUS AND THE PLENTEOUS SOURCE DISAPPEAR BELOW LEAVING A WHIRLPOOL EDDYING IN THE WATER 
lbi-260-123286-0031 AS FOR THEE IF THE AUTHORESS HAS HE RETURNED WHOSE SUBMARINE CAVERN 
lbi-260-123288-0000 THE ROARINGS BECOME LOST IN THE DISTANCE 
lbi-260-123288-0001 THE WEATHER IF WE MAY USE THE TERM WILL CHANGE BEFORE LONG 
lbi-260-123288-0002 THE ATMOSPHERE IS CHARGED WITH VAPORS PERVADED WITH THE ELECTRICITY GENERATED BY THE EVAPORATION OF SAILING WATERS 
lbi-260-123288-0003 THE ELECTRIC LIGHT COULD SCARCELY PENETRATE THE DENSE CURTAIN WHICH IS DROPPED OVER THE THEATRE ON WHICH THE BATTLE OF THE ELEMENTS IS ABOUT TO BE WAGED 
lbi-260-123288-0004 THE AIR IS HEAVY THE SEA IS CALM 
lbi-260-123288-0005 FROM TIME TO TIME A FLEECY TUFT OF MISS WILL YET SOME GLEAMING LIGHT LEFT UPON IT DROPS DOWN UPON THE DANCE FLOOR OF GRAY AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE OPAQUE AND IMPENETRABLE MASS 
lbi-260-123288-0006 THE ATMOSPHERE IS EVIDENTLY CHARGED AND SURCHARGED WITH ELECTRICITY 
lbi-260-123288-0007 THE WIND NEVER LULLS BUT TO ACQUIRE INCREASED STRENGTH THE VAST BANK OF HEAVY CLOUDS IS A HUGE RESERVOIR OF FEARFUL WINDY GUSTS AND RUSHING STORMS 
lbi-260-123288-0008 THERE'S A HEAVY STORM COMING ON I CRIED POINTING TOWARDS THE HORIZON 
lbi-260-123288-0009 THOSE CLOUDS SEEM AS IF THEY WERE GOING ACROSS THE SEA 
lbi-260-123288-0010 ON THE MAST ALREADY I SEE THE LIGHT PLAY OF ALARM AT A SAINT ELMO'S FIRE THE OUTSTRETCHED SAIL CATCHES NOT A BREATH OF WIND AND HANGS LIKE A SHEET OF LEAD 
lbi-260-123288-0011 BUT WE HAVE NOW CEASED TO ADVANCE WHY DO WE LEAVE THAT SAIL LOOSE WHICH AT THE FIRST SHOCK OF A TEMPEST MAY CAPSIZE US IN A MOMENT 
lbi-260-123288-0012 THAT WILL BE THE SAFEST NO NO NEVER 
lbi-260-123288-0013 THE PILED UP VAPORS CONDENSED INTO WATER AND THE AIR PUT INTO VIOLENT ACTION TO SUPPLY THE VACUUM LEFT BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE MISTS ROUSES ITSELF INTO A WHIRLWIND 
lbi-260-123288-0014 HAHN STIRS NOT 
lbi-260-123288-0015 FROM THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE CLOUDS THEIR CONTINUAL MISSIONS OF LURID LIGHT ELECTRIC MATTER IS IN CONTINUAL EVOLUTION FROM THEIR COMPONENT MOLECULES THE GASEOUS ELEMENTS OF THE AIR NEED BE SLAKED WITH MOISTURE FOR INNUMERABLE COLUMNS OF WATER RUSH UPWARDS INTO THE AIR AND FALL BACK AGAIN IN WHITE FOAM 
lbi-260-123288-0016 I REFERRED THE THERMOMETER IT INDICATES THE FIGURE IS OBLITERATED 
lbi-260-123288-0017 IS THE ATMOSPHERIC CONDITION HAVING ONCE REACHED THIS DENSITY TO BECOME FINAL 
lbi-260-123288-0018 THE RAFT BEARS ON STILL TO THE SOUTH EAST 
lbi-260-123288-0019 AT NOON THE VIOLENCE OF THE STORM REDOUBLES 
lbi-260-123288-0020 EACH OF US IS LASHED TO SOME PART OF THE RAFT 
lbi-260-123288-0021 THE WAVES RISE ABOVE OUR HEADS 
lbi-260-123288-0022 THEY SEEM TO BE WE ARE LOST BUT I AM NOT SURE 
lbi-260-123288-0023 HE NODS HIS CONSENT 
lbi-260-123288-0024 THE FIREBALL HALF OF IT WHY HATH AZOR BLUE AND THE SIZE OF A TEN INCH SHELL MOVED SLOWLY ABOUT THE RAFT BUT REVOLVING ON ITS OWN AXIS WITH ASTONISHING VELOCITY AS IF WHIPPED ROUND BY THE FORCE OF A WHIRLWIND 
lbi-260-123288-0025 HERE IT COMES THERE IT GLIDES NOW IT IS UP THE RAGGED STUMP OF THE MAST THENCE IT LIGHTLY LEAPS ON THE PROVISION BAG DESCENDS WITH A LIGHT BOUND AND JUST SKIMS THE POWDER MAGAZINE HORRIBLE 
lbi-260-123288-0026 WE SHALL BE BLOWN UP BUT NO THE DAZZLING DISK OF MYSTERIOUS LIGHT NIMBLY LEAPS ASIDE IT APPROACHES HANS WHO FIXES HIS BLUE EYE UPON IT STEADILY IT THREATENS THE HEAD OF MY UNCLE WHO FALLS UPON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD DOWN TO AVOID IT 
lbi-260-123288-0027 A SUFFOCATING SMELL OF NITROGEN FILLS THE AIR IT ENTERS THE THROAT IT FILLS THE LUNGS 
lbi-260-123288-0028 WE SUFFER STIFLING PANES 
lbi-260-123440-0000 AND HOW ODD THE DIRECTIONS WILL LOOK 
lbi-260-123440-0001 POOR ALICE 
lbi-260-123440-0002 IT WAS THE WHITE RABBIT RETURNING SPLENDIDLY DRESSED IN A PAIR OF WHITE KID GLOVES IN ONE HAND AND A LARGE FAN IN THE OTHER HE CAME TROTTING ALONG IN A GREAT HURRY MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AS HE CAME O THE DUCHESS THE DUCHESS 
lbi-260-123440-0003 OH WON'T SHE BE SAVAGE IF I'VE KEPT YOU WAITING 
lbi-260-123440-0004 ALICE TOOK UP THE FAN AND GLOVES AND AS THE HALL WAS VERY HOT SHE KEPT FANNING HERSELF ALL THE TIME SHE WENT ON TALKING DEAR DEAR HOW QUEER EVERYTHING IS TODAY 
lbi-260-123440-0005 AND YESTERDAY THINGS WENT ON JUST AS USUAL 
lbi-260-123440-0006 I WONDER IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT 
lbi-260-123440-0007 I ALMOST THINK I CAN REMEMBER FEELING A LITTLE DIFFERENT 
lbi-260-123440-0008 I'LL TRY IF I KNEW ALL THE THINGS I USED TO KNOW 
lbi-260-123440-0009 I SHALL NEVER GET TO TWENTY AT THAT RATE 
lbi-260-123440-0010 HOW CHEERFULLY HE SEEMS TO GROW AND HOW NEATLY SPREAD HIS CLAWS AND WELCOME LITTLE FISHES IN WITH GENTLY SMILING JAWS 
lbi-260-123440-0011 NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT IF I'M ABLE I'LL STAY DOWN HERE 
lbi-260-123440-0012 IT'LL BE NO USE THEIR PUTTING THEIR HEADS DOWN AND SANG COME UP AGAIN DEAR 
lbi-260-123440-0013 I AM SO VERY TIRED OF BEING ALL ALONE HERE 
lbi-260-123440-0014 AND I DECLARE IT'S TOO BAD THAT IT IS 
lbi-260-123440-0015 I WISH I HADN'T CRIED SO MUCH SAID ALICE AS SHE SWAM ABOUT TRYING TO FIND HER WAY OUT 
lbi-260-123440-0016 I SHALL BE PUNISHED FOR IT NOW I SUPPOSE BY BEING DROWNED IN MY OWN TEARS 
lbi-260-123440-0017 THAT WILL BE A QUEER THING TO BE SURE 
lbi-260-123440-0018 I AM VERY TIRED OF SWIMMING ABOUT HERE O MOUSE 
lbi-260-123440-0019 CRIED ALICE AGAIN FOR THIS TIME THE MOUSE WAS BRISTLING ALL OVER AND SHE FELT CERTAIN IT MUST BE REALLY OFFENDED 
lbi-260-123440-0020 WE WON'T TALK ABOUT HER ANY MORE IF YOU'D RATHER NOT WE INDEED 
lbi-2830-3979-0000 WE WANT YOU TO HELP US PUBLISH SOME LEADING WORK OF LUTHER'S FOR THE GENERAL AMERICAN MARKET WILL YOU DO IT 
lbi-2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAMLINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS 
lbi-2830-3979-0002 LET US BEGIN WITH THAT HIS COMMENTARY ON THE GALATIANS 
lbi-2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE 
lbi-2830-3979-0004 IT WAS WRITTEN IN LATIN 
lbi-2830-3979-0005 THE WORK HAD TO BE CONDENSED 
lbi-2830-3979-0006 A WORD SHOULD NOW BE SAID ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF LUTHER'S COMMENTARY ON GALATIANS 
lbi-2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN EDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MY GALATIANS FOR INSTANCE 
lbi-2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESS TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND RORA PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER 
lbi-2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE 
lbi-2830-3979-0010 BUT THE ESSENCE OF LUTHER'S LECTURES IS THERE 
lbi-2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LUKE TWO 
lbi-2830-3979-0012 THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FOREVER 
lbi-2830-3980-0000 IN EVERY WAY THEY SOUGHT TO UNDERMINE THE AUTHORITY OF SAINT PAUL 
lbi-2830-3980-0001 THEY SAID TO THE GALATIANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGHLY OF PAUL 
lbi-2830-3980-0002 HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CHRIST 
lbi-2830-3980-0003 PAUL CAME LATER AND IS BENEATH US 
lbi-2830-3980-0004 INDEED HE PERSECUTED THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME 
lbi-2830-3980-0005 DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SAKE OF A FEW LUTHERAN HERETICKS WOULD DISOWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH 
lbi-2830-3980-0006 AGAINST THESE BOASTING FALSE APOSTLES PAUL BOLDLY DEFENDS HIS APOSTOLIC AUTHORITY AND MINISTRY 
lbi-2830-3980-0007 AS THE AMBASSADOR OF A GOVERNMENT IS HONORED FOR HIS OFFICE AND NOT FOR HIS PRIVATE PERSON SO THE MINISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EXALT HIS OFFICE IN ORDER TO GAIN AUTHORITY AMONG MEN 
lbi-2830-3980-0008 PAUL TAKES PRIDE IN HIS MINISTRY NOT TO HIS OWN PRAISE BUT TO THE PRAISE OF GOD 
lbi-2830-3980-0009 PAUL AN APOSTLE NOT OF MEN ET CETERA 
lbi-2830-3980-0010 EITHER HE CALLS MINISTERS THROUGH THE AGENCY OF MEN OR HE CALLS THEM DIRECTLY AS HE CALLED THE PROPHETS AND APOSTLES 
lbi-2830-3980-0011 PAUL DECLARES THAT THE FALSE APOSTLES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER MY MEN NOR BY MAN 
lbi-2830-3980-0012 THE MOST THEY COULD CLAIM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS 
lbi-2830-3980-0013 HE MENTIONS THE APOSTLES FIRST BECAUSE THERE WERE APPOINTED DIRECTLY BY GOD 
lbi-2830-3980-0014 THE CALL WAS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY 
lbi-2830-3980-0015 FOR A PERSON TO POSSESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH 
lbi-2830-3980-0016 IT SPOILS ONE'S BEST WORK 
lbi-2830-3980-0017 WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PAUL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL 
lbi-2830-3980-0018 I DID NOT THEN REALIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MINISTRY 
lbi-2830-3980-0019 I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCTRINE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE TAUGHT SO HISTORY INSTEAD OF CERTAINTY AND NOBODY UNDERSTOOD SPIRITUAL BOASTING 
lbi-2830-3980-0020 THIS IS NO SINFUL PRIDE IT IS WHOLLY PRIDE 
lbi-2830-3980-0021 AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RAISED HIM FROM THE DEAD 
lbi-2830-3980-0022 THE CLAWS SEEMED SUPERFLUOUS ON FIRST SIGHT 
lbi-2830-3980-0023 THESE PERVERTERS OF THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF CHRIST RESIST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORKS OF THEM BOTH 
lbi-2830-3980-0024 IN THIS WHOLE EPISTLE PAUL TREATS OF THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST 
lbi-2830-3980-0025 BY HIS RESURRECTION CHRIST WON THE VICTORY OVER LAW SIN FLESH WORLD DEVIL DEATH HELL AND EVERY EVIL 
lbi-2830-3980-0026 FIRST TOO 
lbi-2830-3980-0027 AND ALL THE BREAD ROOM WHICH ARE WITH ME 
lbi-2830-3980-0028 THIS SHOULD GO FAR AND SHUTTING THE MOUTHS OF THE FALSE APOSTLES 
lbi-2830-3980-0029 ALTHOUGH THE BRETHREN WITH ME ARE NOT APOSTLES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WRITE AND TEACH AS I DO 
lbi-2830-3980-0030 THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEMIES OF THE GOSPEL PREDOMINATE THEY GO WHERE THE CHRISTIANS ARE 
lbi-2830-3980-0031 WHY DID THEY NOT INVADE THE CATHOLIC PROVINCES AND PREACH THEIR DOCTRINE TO GODLESS PRINCES BISHOPS AND DOCTORS AS WE HAVE THEM BY THE HELP OF GOD 
lbi-2830-3980-0032 WE LOOK FOR THE REWARD WHICH EYE HATH NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HATH ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN 
lbi-2830-3980-0033 NOT ALL THE GALATIANS HAD BECOME PERVERTED 
lbi-2830-3980-0034 THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONTAMINATED 
lbi-2830-3980-0035 THEY REMAIN DIVINE REGARDLESS OF MEN'S OPINION 
lbi-2830-3980-0036 WHEREVER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HOLY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH ANTI CHRIST REIGNS THERE 
lbi-2830-3980-0037 SO MUCH FOR THE TITLE OF THE EPISTLE NOW FOLLOWS THE READING OF THE APOSTLE VERSE THREE 
lbi-2830-3980-0038 GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST 
lbi-2830-3980-0039 THE TERMS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TERMS WITH PAUL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD 
lbi-2830-3980-0040 THE READING OF THE APOSTLES REFRESHING 
lbi-2830-3980-0041 GRACE INVOLVES THE REMISSION OF SINS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONSCIENCE 
lbi-2830-3980-0042 THE WORLD BRANDS THIS PERNICIOUS DOCTRINE 
lbi-2830-3980-0043 EXPERIENCE PROVES THIS 
lbi-2830-3980-0044 HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL 
lbi-2830-3980-0045 MEN SHOULD NOT SPECULATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD 
lbi-2830-3980-0046 WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER 
lbi-2830-3980-0047 TO DO SO AS TO LOSE GOD ALTOGETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOMES INTOLERABLE WHEN WE SEEK TO MEASURE AND COMPREHEND HIS INFINITE MAJESTY 
lbi-2830-3980-0048 HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFFERED WAS CRUCIFIED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEARLY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEARTS AND EYES MAY FASTEN UPON HIM 
lbi-2830-3980-0049 EMBRACE HIM AND FORGET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD 
lbi-2830-3980-0050 DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COMETH UNTO THE FATHER BUT BY ME 
lbi-2830-3980-0051 WHEN YOU ARGUE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD APART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUSTIFICATION YOU MAY BE AS PROFOUND AS YOU LIKE 
lbi-2830-3980-0052 WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APPOINTED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIVINE TEACHER 
lbi-2830-3980-0053 AT THE SAME TIME PAUL CONFIRMS OUR CREED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD 
lbi-2830-3980-0054 THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APPARENT IN THAT PAUL ASCRIBES TO HIM DIVINE POWERS EQUALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INSTANCE THE POWER TO DISPENSE GRACE AND PEACE 
lbi-2830-3980-0055 TO BESTOW PEACE AND GRACE LIES IN THE PROVINCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREATE THESE BLESSINGS THE ANGELS CANNOT 
lbi-2830-3980-0056 OTHERWISE PAUL SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER IN PEACE FROM OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST 
lbi-2830-3980-0057 THE ARIANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NOBLE AND PERFECT CREATURE SUPERIOR EVEN TO THE ANGELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREATED HEAVEN AND EARTH 
lbi-2830-3980-0058 MAHOMET ALSO SPEAKS HIGHLY OF CHRIST 
lbi-2830-3980-0059 PAUL STICKS TO HIS THEME 
lbi-2830-3980-0060 HE NEVER LOSES SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS EPISTLE 
lbi-2830-3980-0061 NOT GOLD OR SILVER OR PASCHAL LAMBS OR AN ANGEL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR 
lbi-2830-3980-0062 NOT FOR A CROWN OR A KINGDOM OR OUR GOODNESS BEFORE OUR SINS 
lbi-2830-3980-0063 UNDERSCORE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SORE CONSCIENCES 
lbi-2830-3980-0064 HOW MAY WE OBTAIN REMISSION OF OUR SINS 
lbi-2830-3980-0065 PAUL ANSWERS THE MAN WHOSE NAME JESUS CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS 
lbi-2830-3980-0066 SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS IT STANDS TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFFORTS 
lbi-2830-3980-0067 THIS SENTENCE ALSO DEFINES OUR SINS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AMENDS FOR A SINGLE SECOND 
lbi-2830-3980-0068 THE GREATNESS OF THE RANSOM CHRIST THE SON OF GOD INDICATES THIS 
lbi-2830-3980-0069 THE VICIOUS CHARACTER OF SAND IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR SINS 
lbi-2830-3980-0070 BUT WE'RE CARELESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF SIN 
lbi-2830-3980-0071 WE THINK TO BUY SOME LITTLE WORK REMEMBER WE CAN DISMISS HIM 
lbi-2830-3980-0072 THIS PASSAGE THEN BEARS OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER SIN 
lbi-2830-3980-0073 THIS ATTITUDE SPRINGS FROM A FALSE CONCEPTION OF SIN THE CONCEPTION THAT SIN IS A SMALL MATTER EASILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORKS THAT WE MUST PRESENT OURSELVES UNTO GOD WITH A GOOD CONSCIENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO SIN BEFORE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR SINS 
lbi-2830-3980-0074 THIS ATTITUDE IS UNIVERSAL AND PARTICULARLY DEVELOPED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS 
lbi-2830-3980-0075 BUT THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR SINS IS LOST UPON THEM 
lbi-2830-3980-0076 ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRIBLE THAT WE MUST DESPAIR 
lbi-2961-960-0000 HE PASSES ABRUPTLY FROM PERSONS TO IDEAS AND NUMBERS AND FROM IDEAS AND NUMBERS TO PERSONS FROM THE HEAVENS TO MAN FROM ASTRONOMY TO PHYSIOLOGY IT CONFUSES OR RATHER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH SUBJECT AND OBJECT FIRST AND FINAL CAUSES AND IS DREAMING OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES LOST IN A FLUX OF SENSE 
lbi-2961-960-0001 THE INFLUENCE WHICH THE TIMAEUS HAS EXERCISED UPON POSTERITY IS DUE PARTLY TO A MISUNDERSTANDING 
lbi-2961-960-0002 IN THIS SUPPOSED DEPTHS OF THIS DIALOGUE THE NEO PLATONISTS FOUND HIDDEN MEANINGS AND CONNECTIONS WITH THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN SCRIPTURES AND OUT OF THEM THEY ELICITED DOCTRINES QUITE AT VARIANCE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PLATO 
lbi-2961-960-0003 THEY WERE ABSORBED IN HIS THEOLOGY AND WERE UNDER THE DOMINION OF HIS NAME WHILE THAT WHICH WAS TRULY GREAT AND TRULY CORRECT JURIS SICKENED HIM HIS EFFORTS TO REALIZE AND CONNECT OBSTRUCTIONS WAS NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THEM AT ALL 
lbi-2961-960-0004 THERE IS NO DANGER OF THE MODERN COMMENTATORS ON TITINIUS FALLING INTO THE ABSURDITIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS 
lbi-2961-960-0005 IN THE PRESENT DAY WE ARE WELL AWARE THAT AN ANCIENT PHILOSOPHER IS TO BE INTERPRETED FROM HIMSELF AND BY THE CONTEMPORARY HISTORY OF THOUGHT 
lbi-2961-960-0006 THE FANCIES OF THE NEO PLATONISTS ARE ONLY INTERESTING TO US BECAUSE THEY EXHIBIT A PHASE OF THE HUMAN MIND WHICH PREVAILED WIDELY IN THE FIRST CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA AND IS NOT WHOLLY EXTINCT IN OUR OWN DAY 
lbi-2961-960-0007 BUT THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF PLATO AND IN SPIRIT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO HIM 
lbi-2961-960-0008 WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLATO WOULD HAVE ARRANGED HIS OWN DIALOGUES OR WHETHER DE THOUGHT OF ARRANGING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRILOGIES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESSLY CONNECTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND 
lbi-2961-960-0009 THE DIALOGUE IS PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE ANIMAL CREATION INCLUDING UNDER THIS TERM THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIMALS 
lbi-2961-960-0010 BUT HE HAS NOT AS YET THE FIND THIS INTERMEDIATE TERRITORY WHICH LIES SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MEDICINE AND MATHEMATICS AND HE WOULD HAVE FELT THAT THERE WAS AS GREAT AN IMPIETY IN DRINKING THEORIES OF PHYSICS FIRST IN THE ORDER OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN PLACING THE BODY BEFORE THE SOUL 
lbi-2961-960-0011 WITH HERACLITUS HE ACKNOWLEDGES THE PERPETUAL FLUX LIKE ANAXAGORAS HE ASSERTS THE PREDOMINANCE OF MINE ALTHOUGH ADMITTING AN ELEMENT OF NECESSITY WHICH REASON IS INCAPABLE OF SUBDUING WIPED THE PYTHAGOREANS HE SUPPOSES THE MYSTERY OF THE WORLD TO BE CONTAINED IN NUMBER 
lbi-2961-960-0012 MANY IF NOT ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THE PRE SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY ARE INCLUDED IN THE TIMAEUS 
lbi-2961-960-0013 IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE RELATION OF THE IDEAS TO GOD OR OF GOD TO THE WORLD WAS DIFFERENTLY CONCEIVED BY HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF HIS LIFE 
lbi-2961-960-0014 THE IDEAS ALSO REMAIN BUT THEY HAVE BECOME TYPES IN NATURE FORMS OF MEN ANIMALS BIRDS FISHES 
lbi-2961-960-0015 THE STYLE AND PLAN OF TITINIUS DIFFER GREATLY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLATONIC DIALOGUES 
lbi-2961-960-0016 BUT PLATO HAS NOT THE SAME MASTERY OVER HIS INSTRUMENT WHICH HE EXHIBITS IN THE FEATURES OR SYMPOSIUM 
lbi-2961-960-0017 NOTHING CAN EXCEED THE BEAUTY WERE OUR TILTING PRODUCTION IN WHICH HE'S USING WORDS AFTER HIS ACCUSTOMED MANNER 
lbi-2961-960-0018 BUT IN THE REST OF THE WORK THE POWER OF LANGUAGE SEEMS TO FAIL HIM AND THE DRAMATIC FORM IS WHOLLY GIVEN UP 
lbi-2961-960-0019 HE COULD WRITE IN ONE STYLE BUT NOT IN ANOTHER THE GREEK LANGUAGE HAD NOT AS YET BEEN FASHIONED BY ANY POET OR PHILOSOPHER TO DESCRIBE PHYSICAL PHENOMENA 
lbi-2961-960-0020 AND HENCE WE FIND THE SAME SORT OF CLUMSINESS IN THE TIMAEUS OF PLATO WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE PHILOSOPHICAL POEM OF LUCRETIUS 
lbi-2961-960-0021 THERE IS A WANT OF SLOW AND OFTEN A DEFECT OF RHYTHM THE MEANING IS SOMETIMES OBSCURE AND THERE IS A GREATER USE OF DEPOSITION AND MORE OF REPETITION THAN OCCURS IN PLATO'S EARLIER WRITINGS 
lbi-2961-960-0022 PLATO HAD NOT THE COMMAND OF HIS MATERIALS WHICH WOULD HAVE ENABLED HIM TO PRODUCE A PERFECT WORK OF ART 
lbi-2961-961-0000 SOCRATES BEGINS TO TUNIS WITH A SUMMARY OF THE REPUBLIC 
lbi-2961-961-0001 AND NOW HE DESIRES TO SEE THE IDEAL STATE SET IN MOTION IT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW SHE BEHAVED IN SOME GREAT STRUGGLE 
lbi-2961-961-0002 AND THEREFORE TO YOU I TURN TO ME AS CITIZEN OF LOCRIS WORE AT ONCE A PHILOSOPHER AND A STATESMAN AND TO YOU CRITIAS WHOM ALL ATHENIANS NO TO BE SINGULARLY ACCOMPLISHED UNTO HER MOST COURTEOUS WAS ALSO FITTED BY NATURE AND EDUCATION TO SHARE IN OUR DISCOURSE 
lbi-2961-961-0003 I WILL IF TOMMY'S APPROVES I APPROVE 
lbi-2961-961-0004 LISTEN THEN SOCRATES TO A TALE OF SALIS WHO BEING THE FRIEND OF JUSTICE MY GREAT GRANDFATHER TOLD IT TO MY GRANDFATHER CRITIAS AND HE TOLD ME 
lbi-2961-961-0005 SOME POEMS OF SOLEMN WERE RECITED BY THE BOYS 
lbi-2961-961-0006 AND WHAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE POEM SAID THE PERSON WHO MADE THE REMARK 
lbi-2961-961-0007 THE SUBJECT WAS A VERY NOBLE ONE HE DESCRIBED THE MOST FAMOUS ACTION IN WHICH THE ATHENIAN PEOPLE WERE EVER ENGAGED 
lbi-2961-961-0008 THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXPLOITS HAD PASSED AWAY OWING TO THE LAPSE OF TIME AND THE EXTINCTION OF THE ACTORS 
lbi-2961-961-0009 TELL US SAID THE OTHER THE WHOLE STORY AND WHERE SOLOMON HEARD THE STORY 
lbi-2961-961-0010 BUT IN EGYPT THE TRADITIONS OF HER OWN AND OTHER LANDS ARE BY US REGISTERED FOREVER IN OUR TEMPLES 
lbi-2961-961-0011 THE GENEALOGIES WHICH HAVE RECITED TO US OUT OF YOUR OWN AND OLD SOL AN ARE A MERE CHILDREN'S STORY 
lbi-2961-961-0012 FOR IN THE TIMES BEFORE THE GREAT FLOOD ATHENS WAS THE GREATEST AND BEST OF CITIES AND DEAD THE NOBLEST DEEDS AND HAD THE BEST CONSTITUTION OF ANY UNDER THE FACE OF HEAVEN 
lbi-2961-961-0013 SOLEMN MARVELLED AND DESIRED TO BE INFORMED OF THE PARTICULARS 
lbi-2961-961-0014 NINE THOUSAND YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE YOU FOUND YOURS AND EIGHT THOUSAND SINCE SHE FOUND IN OURS AS OUR ANNALS RECORD 
lbi-2961-961-0015 MANY LAWS EXIST AMONG US WHICH ARE THE COUNTERPART OF YOURS AS THEY WERE IN THE OLDEN TIME 
lbi-2961-961-0016 I WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE HIM TO YOU AND YOU SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT OF THEM AT YOUR LEISURE IN THE SECRET REGISTERS 
lbi-2961-961-0017 OBSERVE AGAIN WHAT CHEERED A LUK TUK IN THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM SEARCHING OUT THE DEEP THINGS OF THE WORLD AND APPLYING THEM TO THE USE OF MEN 
lbi-2961-961-0018 THE MOST FAMOUS OF THEM ALL WAS THE OVERTHROW OF THE ISLAND OF APPRENTICE 
lbi-2961-961-0019 FOR AT THE PERIL OF HER OWN EXISTENCE AND WHEN THE OTTER HELLENES HAD DESERTED HER SHE REPELLED THE INVADER AND OF HER OWN ACCORD GAVE LIBERTY TO ALL THE NATIONS WITHIN THE PILLARS 
lbi-2961-961-0020 THIS IS THE EXPLANATION OF THE SHALLOWS WHICH ARE FOUND IN THAT PART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN 
lbi-2961-961-0021 BUT I WOULD NOT SPEAK AT THE TIME BECAUSE I WANTED TO REFRESH MY MEMORY 
lbi-2961-961-0022 BUT NOW LET ME EXPLAIN TO YOU THE ORDER OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT FIRST TIMAEUS WHO IS A NATURAL PHILOSOPHER WILL SPEAK OF THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD GOING DOWN TO THE CREATION OF MAN AND THEN I SHALL RECEIVE THE MAN WHOM HE HAS CREATED AND SOME OF THEM WILL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY YOU AND INTRODUCE THEM TO YOU AS THE LAST ATHENIAN CITIZENS OF WHOM THE EGYPTIAN RECORDS SPOKE 
lbi-3570-5694-0000 BUT ALREADY AT A POINT IN ECONOMIC EVOLUTION FAR AND STATING THE EMERGENCE OF THE LADY SPECIALIZED CONSUMPTION OF GOODS AS AN EVIDENCE OF PECUNIARY STRENGTH HAD BEGUN TO WORK OUT IN A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM 
lbi-3570-5694-0001 THEA TILT OF CONSUMPTION AS AN EVIDENCE OF WEALTH IS TO BE CLASSED AS A DERIVATIVE GROWTH 
lbi-3570-5694-0002 SUCH CONSUMPTION IS FALSE THROUGH THE WOMEN IS MERELY INCIDENTAL TO THEIR WORK IT IS A MEANS TO THEIR CONTINUED LABOUR AND NOT A CONCEPTION DIRECTED TO THEIR OWN COMFORT AND FULNESS OF LIFE 
lbi-3570-5694-0003 WITH A FURTHER ADVANCE IN CULTURE THIS TUB YOU MAY CHANGE INTO SIMPLE CUSTOM OF A MORE OR LESS RIGOROUS CHARACTER BUT WHATEVER BE THE THEORETICAL BASIS OF THE DISTINCTION WHICH IS MAINTAINED WHETHER IT BE A TIBBOO OR A LODGE OF CONVENTIONALITY THE FEATURES OF THE CONVENTIONAL SCHEME OF CONSUMPTION DOES NOT CHANGE EASILY 
lbi-3570-5694-0004 IN THE NATURE OF THINGS LUXURIES AND THE COMFORTS OF LIFE BELONGED TO THE LEISURE CLASS 
lbi-3570-5694-0005 UNDER THE TIBBOOS CERTAIN VICTUALS AND MOPSTICK CLEARLY CERTAIN BEVERAGES ARE STRICTLY RESERVED FOR THE USE OF THE SUPERIOR CLASS 
lbi-3570-5694-0006 DRUNKENNESS AND THE OTHER PATHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE FREE USE OF STIMULANTS THEY ATTEND IN THEIR TURN TO BECOME HONORIFIC AS BEING A MOCK AT THE SECOND REMOVE OF THE SUPERIOR STATUS OF THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO AFFORD THE INDULGENCE 
lbi-3570-5694-0007 IT HAS EVEN HAPPENED THAT THE NAME FOR CERTAIN DISEASED CONDITION OF THE BODY ARISING FROM SUCH AN ORIGIN HAS PASSED INTO EVERYDAY SPEECH AS A SYNONYM FOR NOBLE OR GENTLE 
lbi-3570-5694-0008 THE CONSUMPTION OF LUXURIES IN THE TRUE SENSE HIS CONSUMPTION DIRECTED TO THE COMFORT OF THE CONSUMER HIMSELF AND IS THEREFORE A MARK OF THE MASTER 
lbi-3570-5694-0009 WITH MANY QUALIFICATIONS WITH MORE QUALIFICATIONS AS THE PATRIARCHAL TRADITION HAS GRADUALLY WEAKENED THE GENERAL RULE IS FELT TO BE RIGHT AND BINDING THAT WOMEN SHOULD CONSUME ONLY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THEIR MASTERS 
lbi-3570-5694-0010 THE OBJECTION OF COURSE PRESENTS ITSELF THAT EXPENDITURE ON WOMEN'S DRESS AND HOUSEHOLD PARAPHERNALIA IS AN OBVIOUS EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE BUT IT WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL THAT THIS EXCEPTION IS MUCH MORE OF THIS UNSUBSTANTIAL 
lbi-3570-5694-0011 THE CUSTOM OF FESTIVE GATHERINGS PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN MOTIVES OF CONVIVIALITY AND RELIGION THESE MOTIVES ARE ALSO PRESENT IN THE LATER DEVELOPMENT BUT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE TO BE THE SOLE MOTIVES 
lbi-3570-5694-0012 THERE IS A MORE OR LESS ELABORATE SYSTEM OF RANK INGRATES 
lbi-3570-5694-0013 THIS DIFFERENTIATION IS FURTHERED BY THE INHERITANCE OF WEALTH AND THE CONSEQUENT INHERITANCE OF GENTILITY 
lbi-3570-5694-0014 MANY OF THESE AFFILIATED GENTLEMEN OF LEISURE ARE AT THE SAME TIME THE CEMENT OF SUBSTANCE IN THEIR OWN RIGHT SO THAT SOME OF THEM ASKANCE NETTLE OTHERS ONLY PARTIALLY TO BE RATED AS VICARIOUS CONSUME US 
lbi-3570-5694-0015 SO MANY OF THEM HOWEVER AS MAKE UP THE RETAINERS AND HANGERS ON OF THE PATRON MAY BE CLASSED AS VICARIOUS CONSUMETH WITHOUT QUALIFICATION 
lbi-3570-5694-0016 MANY OF THESE AGAIN AND ALSO MANY OF THE ARISTOCRACY OF LESS DEGREE HAVE INTEREST ATTACHED TO THE PERSONS AND MORE OR LESS COMPREHENSIVE GROUP OF VICARIOUS CONSUMER IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN THEIR SERVANTS RETAINERS ET CETERA 
lbi-3570-5694-0017 THE WEARING OF UNIFORM DELIVERIES IMPLIES A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF DEPENDENCE AND MAY EVEN BE SAID TO BE A MARK OF SERVITUDE REAL OR OSTENSIBLE 
lbi-3570-5694-0018 THE WEARERS OF UNIFORMS AND LIBERTIES MAY BE ROUGHLY DIVIDED INTO TWO CLASSES THE FREE AND THE SEVEN ARE THE NOBLE AND THE IGNOBLE 
lbi-3570-5694-0019 BUT THE GENTLE DISTINCTION IS NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT TO BE OVERLOOKED 
lbi-3570-5694-0020 SO THOSE OFFICES WHICH ARE BY RIGHT THE PROPER EMPLOYMENT OF THE LEISURE CLASS A NOBLE SUCH AS GOVERNMENT FIGHTING HUNTING THE CARE OF ARMS AND ACCOUTREMENTS AND THE LIKE IN SHORT THOSE WHICH MAY BE CLASSED AS OSTENSIBLY PREDATORY EMPLOYMENTS 
lbi-3570-5694-0021 WHENEVER AS IN THESE CASES THE MENIAL SERVICE IN QUESTION HAS TO DO DIRECTLY WITH A PRIME RELIGIOUS EMPLOYMENTS OF FIGHTING AND HUNTING IT EASILY ACQUIRES A REFLECTED A TERRIFIC CHARACTER 
lbi-3570-5694-0022 THE LIVERY BECOMES OF NOXIOUS TO NEARLY ALL WHO ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR IT 
lbi-3570-5695-0000 IN A GENERAL WAY THOUGH NOT WHOLLY NOR CONSISTENTLY THESE TWO GROUPS COINCIDE 
lbi-3570-5695-0001 THEY DEPEND AND TO US FIRST DELEGATED FOR THESE DUTIES WAS THE WIFE OF A CHIEF WIFE AND AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN A LATER DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTION WHEN THE NUMBER OF PERSONS BY WHOM THESE DUTIES ARE CUSTOMARILY PERFORMED GRADUALLY NARROWS THE WIFE REMAINS THE LAST 
lbi-3570-5695-0002 BUT AS WE DESCEND THE SOCIAL SCALE THE POINT IS PRESENTLY REACHED WHERE THE DUTIES OF VICARIOUS PLEASURE IN CONSUMPTION DEVOLVE UPON THE WIFE ALONE 
lbi-3570-5695-0003 IN THE COMMUNITIES OF THE WEST AND CULTURE THIS POINT AS AT PRESENT FOUND AMONG THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASS 
lbi-3570-5695-0004 IF BEAUTY OR COMFORT IS ACHIEVED AND IT IS A MORE OR LESS FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES FOR THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED BY MEANS AND METHODS THAT COMMEND THEMSELVES TO THE GREAT ECONOMIC LAW OF WASTED EFFORT 
lbi-3570-5695-0005 THE MAN OF THE HOUSEHOLD ALSO CAN DO SOMETHING IN THIS DIRECTION AND INDEED HE COMMONLY DOES BUT WITH A STILL LOWER DESCENT INTO THE LEVELS OF INDIGENCE ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE SLUMS THE MAN AND PRESENTLY ALSO THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY CEASED TO CONSUME VALUABLE GOODS FOR APPEARANCES AND THE WOMAN REMAINS VIRTUALLY THE SOLE EXPONENT OF THE HOUSEHOLDS PECUNIARY DECENCY 
lbi-3570-5695-0006 VERY MUCH OF SQUALOR AND DISCOMFORT WILL BE ENDURED BEFORE THE LAST TRINKET OR THE LAST PRETENCE OF PECUNIARY DECENCIES PUT AWAY 
lbi-3570-5695-0007 THERE IS NO CLASS AND NO COUNTRY THAT EYES YIELDED SO ABJECTLY BEFORE THE PRESSURE OF PHYSICAL WANT AS TO DENY THEMSELVES ALL GRATIFICATION OF THIS HIGHER OR SPIRITUAL NEED 
lbi-3570-5695-0008 THE QUESTION IS WHICH OF THE TWO METHODS WILL MOST EFFECTIVELY REACH THE PERSONS WHOSE CONVICTIONS IT IS DESIRED TO EFFECT 
lbi-3570-5695-0009 EACH WILL THEREFORE SERVE ABOUT EQUALLY WELL DURING THE EARLIER STAGES OF SOCIAL GROWTH 
lbi-3570-5695-0010 THE MODERN ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY WORKS IN THE SAME DIRECTION ALSO BY ANOTHER LINE 
lbi-3570-5695-0011 IT IS EVIDENT THEREFORE THAT THE PRESENT TREND OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS IN THE DIRECTION OF HEIGHTENING THE UTILITY OF CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION AS COMPARED WITH LEISURE 
lbi-3570-5695-0012 IT IS ALSO NOTICEABLE THAT THE SENSIBILITY OF CONSUMPTION AS A MEANS OF REPUTE AS WELL AS THE INSISTENCE ON IT AS AN ELEMENT OF DECENCY IS AT ITS BEST IN THOSE PORTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY WITH HUMAN CONDUCT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS WIDEST AND THE MOBILITY OF THE POPULATION IS GREATEST 
lbi-3570-5695-0013 CONSUMPTION BECOMES A LARGE ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THE CITY THAN IN THE COUNTRY 
lbi-3570-5695-0014 AMONG THE COUNTRY POPULATION ITS PLACE IS TO SOME EXTENT TAKEN BY SAVINGS AND HOME COMFORTS KNOWN THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF NEIGHBORHOOD GOSSIP SUFFICIENTLY TO SERVE THEE LIKE GENERAL PURPOSE OF PECUNIARY REPUTE 
lbi-3570-5695-0015 THE RESULT IS A GREAT ABILITY OF THE LABOUR EMPLOYED IN PRINTING PERHAPS GREATER THAN IN ANY OTHER EQUALLY WELL DEFINED AND CONSIDERABLE BODY OF WORKMEN 
lbi-3570-5696-0000 UNDER THE SIMPLE TEST OF EFFECTIVENESS FOR ADVERTISING WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND LEISURE AND THE CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION OF GOODS DIVIDING THE FIELD OF PECUNIARY EMULATION PRETTY EVENLY BETWEEN THEM AT THE OUTSET 
lbi-3570-5696-0001 BUT THE ACTUAL COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THIS IDEAL SCHEME LEISURE HELD THE FIRST PLACE AT THE START AND CAME TOLD A RANK FROM A TUBE OF WASTEFUL CONSUMPTION OF GOODS BOTH AS A DIRECT EXPONENT OF WEALTH AND AS AN ELEMENT IN THE STANDARD OF DECENCY DURING THE COURSE I PEACEABLE CULTURE 
lbi-3570-5696-0002 OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTING THAT INSTINCT DISPOSES MEN TO LOOK WITH FAVOUR UPON PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY AND ON WHATEVER IS OF HUMAN USE 
lbi-3570-5696-0003 A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE TWO CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS IS EFFECTED BY RESORT TO MAKE BELIEVE MEN IN INTRICATE POLITE OBSERVANCES OF SOCIAL DUTIES OF A CEREMONIAL NATURE ARE DEVELOPED MANY ORGANIZATIONS FOUNDED WITH SOME SPECIOUS OBJECT OF AMELIORATION EMBODIED IN THEIR OFFICIAL STYLE AND TITLE THERE IS MUCH COMING AND GOING AND A DEAL OF TALK TO THE END THAT THE TALK AS MAY NOT HAVE OCCASION TO REFLECT ON WHAT IS THE EFFECTUAL ECONOMIC VALUE OF THEIR TRAFFIC 
lbi-3570-5696-0004 THE SALIENT FEATURES OF THIS DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC SERVICE HAVE ALREADY BEEN INDICATED 
lbi-3570-5696-0005 THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE REVOLUTION OF CONSPICUOUS EXPENDITURE WHETHER OF GOOD SERVICES OR HUMAN LIFE RUNS THE OBVIOUS IMPLICATION THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTUALLY MENDICANCY AS GOOD FAME IT MUST BE AN EXPENDITURE OF SUPERFLUITIES 
lbi-3570-5696-0006 AS USED IN THE SPEECH OF EVERYDAY LIFE THE WORD CARRIES AN UNDERTONE OF DEPRECATION 
lbi-3570-5696-0007 THE USE OF THE WORD WASTE AS A TECHNICAL TERM THEREFORE IMPLIES NO DEPRECATION OF THE MOTIVES OR OF THE ENDS SOUGHT BY THE CONSUMER UNDER THIS CANON OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE 
lbi-3570-5696-0008 BUT IT IS ON OTHER GROUNDS WORTH NOTING THAT THE TERM WASTE IN THE LANGUAGE OF EVERY DAY LIFE IMPLIES DEPRECATION OF WHAT IS CHARACTERIZED US WASTEFUL 
lbi-3570-5696-0009 IN STRICT ACCURACY NOTHING SHOULD BE INCLUDED UNDER THE HEAD OF CONSPICUOUS WASTE AT SUCH EXPENDITURE AS IS INCURRED ON THE GROUND OF AN INVIDIOUS PECUNIARY COMPARISON 
lbi-3570-5696-0010 AN ARTICLE MAY BE USEFUL IN WASTEFUL BOTH AND ITS UTILITY TO THE CONSUMER MAY BE MADE UP OF USE AND WASTE IN THE MOST VARYING PROPORTIONS 
lbi-3575-170457-0000 AND OFTEN HAS MY MOTHER SAID WHILE ON HER LAP I LAID MY HEAD SHE FEARED FOR A TIME I WAS NOT MADE BUT FOR ETERNITY 
lbi-3575-170457-0001 WHY ARE WE TO BE DENIED EACH OTHER'S SOCIETY 
lbi-3575-170457-0002 WHY ARE WE TO BE DIVIDED 
lbi-3575-170457-0003 SURELY IT MUST BE BECAUSE WE'RE IN DANGER OF LOVING EACH OTHER TOO WELL I'VE LOSING SIGHT OF THE CREATOR AND IDOLATRY OF THE CREATURE 
lbi-3575-170457-0004 WE USED TO DISPUTE ABOUT POLITICS AND RELIGION 
lbi-3575-170457-0005 SHE A TORY IN CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS ALWAYS IN A MINORITY OF ONE IN OUR HOUSE OF VIOLENT DESCENT AND RADICALISM 
lbi-3575-170457-0006 HER FEEBLE HEALTH GAVE HER HER YIELDING MANNER FOR SHE COULD NEVER OPPOSE ANYONE WITHOUT GATHERING UP ALL HER STRENGTH FOR THE STRUGGLE 
lbi-3575-170457-0007 HE SPOKE FRENCH PERFECTLY I'VE BEEN TOLD WHEN NEED WAS BUT DELIGHTED USUALLY IN TALKING THE BROADEST YORKSHIRE 
lbi-3575-170457-0008 AND SO LIFE AND DEATH HAVE DISPERSED THE CIRCLE OF VIOLIN RADICALS DISSENTERS INTO WHICH TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LITTLE QUIET RESOLUTE CLERGYMAN'S DAUGHTER WAS RECEIVED AND BY WHOM SHE WAS TRULY LOVED AND HONORED 
lbi-3575-170457-0009 JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HAD PASSED AWAY AND STILL THERE WAS NO REPLY FROM SELBY 
lbi-3575-170457-0010 I AM NOT DEPRECIATING IT WHEN I SAY THAT IN THESE TIMES IT IS NOT RARE 
lbi-3575-170457-0011 BUT IT IS NOT WITH A VIEW TO DISTINCTION THAT YOU SHOULD CULTIVATE THIS TALENT IF YOU CONSULT YOUR OWN HAPPINESS 
lbi-3575-170457-0012 YOU WILL SAY THAT A WOMAN HAS NO NEED OF SUCH A CAUTION THERE CAN BE NO PERIL IN IT FOR HER 
lbi-3575-170457-0013 THE MORE SHE IS ENGAGED IN HER PROPER DUTIES THE LAST LEISURE WILL SHE HAVE FOR IT EVEN AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND A RECREATION 
lbi-3575-170457-0014 TO THOSE DUTIES YOU HAVE NOT YET BEEN CALLED AND WHEN YOU ARE YOU WILL BE LESS EAGER FOR CELEBRITY 
lbi-3575-170457-0015 BUT DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT I DISPARAGE THE GIFT WHICH YOU POSSESS NOR THAT I WOULD DISCOURAGE YOU FROM EXERCISING IT I ONLY EXHORT YOU SO TO THINK OF IT AND SO TO USE IT AS TO RENDER IT CONDUCIVE TO YOUR OWN PERMANENT GOOD 
lbi-3575-170457-0016 FAREWELL MADAME 
lbi-3575-170457-0017 THOUGH I MAY BE BUT AN UNGRACIOUS ADVISER YOU WILL ALLOW ME THEREFORE TO SUBSCRIBE MYSELF WITH THE BEST WISHES FOR YOUR HAPPINESS HERE AND HEREAFTER YOUR TRUE FRIEND ROBERT SOBERLY 
lbi-3575-170457-0018 CER MARCH SIXTEENTH 
lbi-3575-170457-0019 I HAVE NOT VENTURED TO HOPE FOR SUCH A REPLY SO CONSIDERATE IN ITS TONE SO NOBLE IN ITS SPIRIT 
lbi-3575-170457-0020 I KNOW THE FIRST LETTER I WROTE TO YOU AS ALL SENSELESS TRASH FROM BEGINNING TO END BUT I AM NOT ALTOGETHER THE IDLE DREAMING BEING IT WOULD SEEM TO DENOTE 
lbi-3575-170457-0021 I THOUGHT IT THEREFORE MY DUTY WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL TO BECOME A GOVERNESS 
lbi-3575-170457-0022 IN THE EVENINGS I CONFESS I DO THINK BUT I NEVER TROUBLE ANYONE ELSE WITH MY THOUGHTS 
lbi-3575-170457-0023 I CAREFULLY AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PREOCCUPATION AND ECCENTRICITY WHICH MIGHT LEAD THOSE I LIVE AMONGST US SUSPECT THE NATURE OF MY PURSUITS 
lbi-3575-170457-0024 I DON'T ALWAYS SUCCEED FOR SOMETIMES WHEN I'M TEACHING OUR SEWING I WOULD RATHER BE READING OR WRITING BUT I TRIED TO DENY MYSELF AND MY FATHER'S APPROBATION AMPLY REWARDED ME FOR THE PRESERVATION 
lbi-3575-170457-0025 AGAIN I THANK YOU THIS INCIDENT I SUPPOSE WILL BE RENEWED NO MORE IF I LIVE TO BE AN OLD WOMAN I SHALL REMEMBER IT THIRTY YEARS HENCE AS A BRIGHT DREAM 
lbi-3575-170457-0026 P S PRAY SIR EXCUSE ME FOR WRITING TO YOU A SECOND TIME I CANNOT HELP WRITING PARTLY TO TELL YOU HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND PARTLY TO LET YOU KNOW THAT YOUR ADVICE SHALL NOT BE WASTED HOWEVER SOFTLY AND RELUCTANTLY AND MAYBE AT FIRST FOLLOWED C B 
lbi-3575-170457-0027 I CANNOT DENY MYSELF THE GRATIFICATION OF INSERTING SO THESE REPLY 
lbi-3575-170457-0028 KESWICK MARCH TWENTY SECOND EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN DEAR MADAME 
lbi-3575-170457-0029 YOUR LETTER HAS GIVEN ME GREAT PLEASURE AND I SHOULD NOT FORGIVE MYSELF IF I DID NOT TELL YOU SO 
lbi-3575-170457-0030 OF THIS SECOND LETTER ALSO SHE SPOKE AND TOLD ME THAT IT CONTAINED AN INVITATION FOR HER TO GO AND SEE THE POET IF EVER SHE VISITED THE LAKES 
lbi-3575-170457-0031 ON AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SHE WRITES 
lbi-3575-170457-0032 COME COME I'M GETTING REALLY TIRED OF YOUR ABSENCE 
lbi-3575-170457-0033 SATURDAY AFTER SATURDAY COMES AROUND AND I CAN HAVE NO HOPE OF HEARING YOUR KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND THEN BEING TOLD THAT MISSY'S COME OH DEAR 
lbi-3575-170457-0034 IN THIS MONOTONOUS LIFE OF MINE THAT WAS A PLEASANT EVENT 
lbi-3575-170457-0035 I WAS NEVER RECUR AGAIN BUT IT WILL TAKE TWO OR THREE INTERVIEWS BEFORE THE STIFFNESS THE ESTRANGEMENT OF THIS LONG SEPARATION WILL WEAR AWAY 
lbi-3575-170457-0036 MY EYES FILL WITH TEARS WHEN I CONTRAST THE BLISS OF SUCH A STATE BRIGHTENED BY HOPES OF THE FUTURE WITH THE MELANCHOLY STATE I NOW LIVE IN UNCERTAIN THAT I EVER FELT TRUE CONTRITION WANDERING IN THOUGHT AND DEED LONGING FOR HOLINESS WHICH I SHALL NEVER NEVER OBTAIN SMITTEN AT TIMES TO THE HEART WITH THE CONVICTION THAT GHASTLY CALVINISTIC DOCTRINES ARE TRUE DARKENED ENSURED BY THE VERY SHADOWS OF SPIRITUAL DEATH 
lbi-3575-170457-0037 IF CHRISTIAN PERFECTION BE NECESSARY TO SALVATION I SHALL NEVER BE SAVED MY HEART AS A VERY HOTBED FOR SINFUL THOUGHTS AND WHEN I DECIDE ON AN ACTION I SCARCELY REMEMBER TO LOOK TO MY REDEEMER FOR DIRECTION 
lbi-3575-170457-0038 AND MEANTIME I KNOW THE GREATNESS OF JEHOVAH I ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFECTION OF HIS WORD I ADORE THE PURITY OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH MY THEORY'S RIGHT MY PRACTICE HORRIBLY WRONG 
lbi-3575-170457-0039 THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS CAME AND SHE AND ANNE RETURNED TO THE PARSONAGE AND TO THAT HAPPY HOME CIRCLE IN WHICH ALONE THEIR NATURES EXPANDED AMONGST ALL OTHER PEOPLE THEY SHRIVELLED UP MORE OR LESS 
lbi-3575-170457-0040 INDEED THERE WERE ONLY ONE OR TWO STRANGERS WHO COULD BE ADMITTED AMONG THE SISTERS WITHOUT PRODUCING THE SAME RESULT 
lbi-3575-170457-0041 SHE WAS GONE OUT INTO THE VILLAGE ON SOME ERRAND WHEN AS SHE WAS DESCENDING THE STEEP STREET HER FOOT SLIPPED ON THE ICE AND SHE FELL IT WAS DARK AND NO ONE SAW HER MISS CHANCE TILL AFTER A TIME HER GROANS ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF A PASSER BY 
lbi-3575-170457-0042 UNFORTUNATELY THE FRACTURE CANNOT BE SET TILL SIX O'CLOCK THE NEXT MORNING AS NO SURGEON WAS TO BE HAD BEFORE THAT TIME AND SHE NOW LIES AT OUR HOUSE IN A VERY DOUBTFUL AND DANGEROUS STATE 
lbi-3575-170457-0043 HOWEVER REMEMBERING WHAT YOU TOLD ME NAMELY THAT YOU HAD COMMENDED THE MATTER TO HIRE DECISION THAN OURS AND THAT YOU ARE RESOLVED TO SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION TO THAT DECISION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE I HOLD IT MY DUTY TO YIELD ALSO AND TO BE SILENT AND MAY BE ALL FOR THE BEST 
lbi-3575-170457-0044 AFTER THIS DISAPPOINTMENT I NEVER DARE RECKON WITH CERTAINTY ON THE ENJOYMENT OF A PLEASURE AGAIN IT SEEMS AS IF SOME FATALITY STOOD BETWEEN YOU AND ME 
lbi-3575-170457-0045 I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU AND YOU MUST BE KEPT FROM THE CONTAMINATION OF TOO INTIMATE SOCIETY 
lbi-3575-170457-0046 A GOOD NEIGHBOUR OF THE BRONTES A CLEVER INTELLIGENT YORKSHIRE WOMAN WHO KEEPS A DRUGGIST'S SHOP IN WORTH AND FROM HER OCCUPATION HER EXPERIENCE AND EXCELLENT SENSE HOLDS THE POSITION OF VILLAGE DOCTRESS AND NURSE AND AS SUCH HAS BEEN A FRIEND AND MANY A TIME OF TRIAL AND SICKNESS AND DEATH IN THE HOUSEHOLD ROUND TOLD ME A CHARACTERISTIC LITTLE INCIDENT CONNECTED WITH TABBIES FRACTURED LEG 
lbi-3575-170457-0047 TABBY HAD LIVED WITH THEM FOR TEN OR TWELVE YEARS AND WAS AS CHARLOTTE EXPRESSED IT ONE OF THE FAMILY 
lbi-3575-170457-0048 HE REFUSED AT FIRST TO LISTEN TO THE CAREFUL ADVICE IT WAS REPUGNANT TO HIS LIBERAL NATURE 
lbi-3575-170457-0049 THIS DECISION WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE GIRLS 
lbi-3575-170457-0050 TABBY HAD TENDED THEM IN THEIR CHILDHOOD THEY AND NONE OTHER SHOULD ATTEND HER IN HER INFIRMITY AND AGE 
lbi-3575-170457-0051 AT TEA TIME THEY WERE SAD AND SILENT AND THE MEAL WENT AWAY UNTOUCHED BY ANY OF THE THREE 
lbi-3575-170457-0052 SHE HAD ANOTHER WEIGHT ON HER MIND THIS CHRISTMAS 
lbi-3575-170457-0053 BUT ANNE HAD BEGUN TO SUFFER JUST BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS AND CHARLOTTE WATCH OVER HER YOUNGER SISTERS WITH THE JEALOUS VIGILANCE OF SOME WILD CREATURE THAT CHANGES HER VERY NATURE IF DANGER THREATENS HER YOUNG 
lbi-3575-170457-0054 STUNG BY ANXIETY FOR THESE LITTLE SISTER SHE UPBRAIDED MISS W FOR HER FANCIED INDIFFERENCE TO AND STATE OF HEALTH 
lbi-3575-170457-0055 STILL HER HEART HAD RECEIVED A SHOCK IN THE PERCEPTION OF ANNE'S DELICACY AND ALL THESE HOLIDAY SHE WATCHED OVER HER WITH A LONGING FOND ANXIETY WHICH IS SO FULL OF SUDDEN PANGS OF FEAR 
lbi-3575-170457-0056 I DOUBT WHETHER BRANWELL WAS MAINTAINING HIMSELF AT THIS TIME 
lbi-3729-6852-0000 TO CELEBRATE THE ARRIVAL OF HER SON SYLVIA GAVE A SPLENDID SUPPER TO WHICH SHE HAD INVITED ALL HER RELATIVES AND IT WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO MAKE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE 
lbi-3729-6852-0001 WITHOUT SAYING IT POSITIVELY SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT BEING HERSELF AN ILLUSTRIOUS MEMBER OF THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS SHE WAS WELL AWARE THAT SHE WAS SPEAKING TO AN INSECT 
lbi-3729-6852-0002 IN ORDER TO PLEASE HER I SPOKE TO HER OF THE ABBEY CONTI AND I HAD OCCASION TO QUOTE TWO LINES OF THAT PROFOUND WRITER 
lbi-3729-6852-0003 MADAME CORRECTED ME WITH A PATRONIZING AIR FOR MY PRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD SCOUNDREL WHICH MEANS DIVIDED SAYING THAT IT OUGHT TO BE PRONOUNCED CURA AND SHE ADDED THAT I OUGHT TO BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH ON THE FIRST DAY OF MY ARRIVAL IN PARIS TELLING ME THAT IT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT DAY IN MY LIFE 
lbi-3729-6852-0004 HER FACE WAS AN ENIGMA FOR IT INSPIRED EVERY ONE WITH THE WARMEST SYMPATHY AND YET IF YOU EXAMINED IT ATTENTIVELY THERE WAS NOT ONE BEAUTIFUL FEATURE SHE COULD NOT BE CALLED HANDSOME BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT HER UGLY 
lbi-3729-6852-0005 SYLVIA WAS THE ADORATION OF FRANCE AND HER TALENT WAS THE REAL SUPPORT OF ALL THE COMEDIES WHICH THE GREATEST AUTHORS WROTE FOR HER ESPECIALLY OF THE PLAYS OF MARIVAUX FOR WITHOUT HER HIS COMEDIES WOULD NEVER HAVE GONE TO POSTERITY 
lbi-3729-6852-0006 SYLVIA DID NOT THINK THAT HER GOOD CONDUCT WAS A MERIT FOR SHE KNEW THAT SHE WAS VIRTUOUS ONLY BECAUSE HER SELF LOVE COMPELLED HER TO BE SO AND SHE NEVER EXHIBITED ANY PRIDE OR ASSUMED ANY SUPERIORITY TOWARDS HER THEATRICAL SISTERS ALTHOUGH SATISFIED TO SHINE BY THEIR TALENTS OR THEIR BEAUTY THEY CARED LITTLE ABOUT RENDERING THEMSELVES CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR VIRTUE 
lbi-3729-6852-0007 TWO YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH I SAW HER PERFORM THE CHARACTER OF MARY ANN IN THE COMEDY OF MERIVALE AND IN SPITE OF HER AGE AND DECLINING HEALTH THE ILLUSION WAS COMPLETE 
lbi-3729-6852-0008 SHE WAS HONOURABLY BURIED IN THE CHURCH OF SAINT SAUVEUR WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION FROM THE VENERABLE PRIEST WHO FAR FROM SHARING THE ANTICHRISTIAN INTOLERANCE OF THE CLERGY IN GENERAL SAID THAT HER PROFESSION AS AN ACTRESS HAD NOT HINDERED HER FROM BEING A GOOD CHRISTIAN AND THAT THE EARTH WAS A COMMON MOTHER OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS AS JESUS CHRIST HAD BEEN THE SAVIOR OF ALL MANKIND 
lbi-3729-6852-0009 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME DEAR READER IF I HAVE MADE TO ATTEND THE FUNERAL OF SYLVIA TEN YEARS BEFORE HER DEATH BELIEVE ME I HAVE NO INTENTION OF PERFORMING A MIRACLE YOU MAY CONSOLE YOURSELF WITH THE IDEA THAT I SHALL SPARE YOU THAT UNPLEASANT TASK WHEN POOR SYLVIA DIES 
lbi-3729-6852-0010 I NEVER HAD ANY FAMILY 
lbi-3729-6852-0011 I HAD A NAME I BELIEVE IN MY YOUNG DAYS BUT I HAVE FORGOTTEN IT SINCE I HAVE BEEN IN SERVICE 
lbi-3729-6852-0012 I SHALL CALL YOU A SPREE 
lbi-3729-6852-0013 YOU DO ME A GREAT HONOUR 
lbi-3729-6852-0014 HERE GO AND GET ME CHANGE FOR LOUIS I HAVE IT SIR 
lbi-3729-6852-0015 AT YOUR SERVICE SIR 
lbi-3729-6852-0016 MADAME GWYN SAW BESIDES CAN ANSWER YOUR INQUIRIES 
lbi-3729-6852-0017 I SEE A QUANTITY OF CHAIRS FOR HIRE AT THE RATE OF ONE SOU MEN READING THE NEWSPAPER AND THE SHADE OF THE TREES GIRLS AND MEN BREAKFASTING EITHER ALONE OR IN COMPANY WAITERS WHO WERE RAPIDLY GOING UP AND DOWN A NARROW STAIRCASE HIDDEN UNDER THE FOLIAGE 
lbi-3729-6852-0018 I SIT DOWN AT A SMALL TABLE A WAITER COMES IMMEDIATELY TO INQUIRE MY WISHES 
lbi-3729-6852-0019 I TELL HIM TO GIVE ME SOME COFFEE IF IT IS GOOD 
lbi-3729-6852-0020 THEN TURNING TOWARDS ME HE SAYS THAT I LOOK LIKE A FOREIGNER AND WHEN I SAY THAT I AM AN ITALIAN HE BEGINS TO SPEAK TO ME OF THE COURT THE CITY THE THEATRES AND AT LAST HE OFFERS TO ACCOMPANY ME EVERYWHERE 
lbi-3729-6852-0021 I THANK HIM AND TAKE MY LEAVE 
lbi-3729-6852-0022 I ADDRESSED HIM IN ITALIAN AND HE ANSWERS VERY WITTILY BUT HIS WAY OF SPEAKING MAKES ME SMILE AND I TELL HIM WHY 
lbi-3729-6852-0023 MY REMARK PLEASES HIM BUT I SOON PROVED TO HIM THAT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO SPEAK HOWEVER PERFECT MAY HAVE BEEN THE LANGUAGE OF THE ANCIENT WRITER 
lbi-3729-6852-0024 I SEE A CROWD IN ONE CORNER OF THE GARDEN EVERYBODY STANDING STILL AND LOOKING UP 
lbi-3729-6852-0025 IS THERE NOT A MERIDIAN EVERYWHERE 
lbi-3729-6852-0026 YES BUT THE MERIDIAN OF THE PALAIS ROYAL IS THE MOST EXACT 
lbi-3729-6852-0027 THAT IS TRUE BAD OLD GLORY 
lbi-3729-6852-0028 ALL THESE HONEST PERSONS ARE WAITING THEIR TURN TO GET THEIR SNUFF BOXES FILLED 
lbi-3729-6852-0029 IT IS SOLD EVERYWHERE BUT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS NOBODY WILL USE ANY SNUFF BUT THAT SOLD AT THE CIVIC CAT 
lbi-3729-6852-0030 IS IT BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE 
lbi-3729-6852-0031 BUT HOW DID SHE MANAGE TO RENDER IT SO FASHIONABLE 
lbi-3729-6852-0032 SIMPLY BY STOPPING HER CARRIAGE TWO OR THREE TIMES BEFORE THE SHOP TO HAVE HER SNUFF BOX FILLED AND BY SAYING ALOUD TO THE YOUNG GIRL WHO HANDED BACK THE BOX THAT HER SNUFF WAS THE VERY BEST IN PARIS 
lbi-3729-6852-0033 YOU ARE NOW AND THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE WIT CAN MAKE A FORTUNE BY SELLING EITHER GENUINE OR FALSE ARTICLE IN THE FIRST CASE IT RECEIVES THE WELCOME OF INTELLIGENT AND TALENTED PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND FOOLS ARE ALWAYS READY TO REWARD IT FOR SILLINESS IS TRULY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PEOPLE HERE AND HOWEVER WONDERFUL IT MAY APPEAR SILLINESS IS THE DAUGHTER OF WIT 
lbi-3729-6852-0034 LET A MAN RUN AND EVERYBODY WILL RUN AFTER HIM THE CROWD WILL NOT STOP UNLESS THE MAN IS PROVED TO BE MAD BUT TO PROVE IT IS INDEED A DIFFICULT TASK BECAUSE WE HAVE A CROWD OF MEN WHO MAD FROM THEIR BIRTH ARE STILL CONSIDERED WISE 
lbi-3729-6852-0035 IT SEEMS TO ME I REPLIED THAT SUCH APPROVAL SUCH RATIFICATION OF THE OPINION EXPRESSED BY THE KING THE PRINCES OF THE BLOOD ET CETERA IS RATHER A PROOF OF THE AFFECTION FELT FOR THEM BY THE NATION FOR THE FRENCH CARRY THAT AFFECTION TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT THEY BELIEVE THEM INFALLIBLE 
lbi-3729-6852-0036 WHEN THE KING COMES TO PARIS EVERYBODY CALLS OUT VIVE LE ROI 
lbi-3729-6852-0037 SHE INTRODUCED ME TO ALL HER GUESTS AND GAVE ME SOME PARTICULARS RESPECTING EVERY ONE OF THEM 
lbi-3729-6852-0038 WHAT SIR I SAID TO HIM AM I FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SEE YOU 
lbi-3729-6852-0039 HE HIMSELF RECITING THE SAME PASSAGE IN FRENCH AND POLITELY POINTED OUT THE PARTS IN WHICH HE THOUGHT THAT I HAD IMPROVED ON THE ORIGINAL 
lbi-3729-6852-0040 FOR THE FIRST DAY SIR I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE GIVES GREAT HOPES OF YOU AND WITHOUT ANY DOUBT YOU WILL MAKE RAPID PROGRESS 
lbi-3729-6852-0041 I BELIEVE IT SIR AND THAT IS WHAT I FEAR THEREFORE THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF MY VISIT HERE IS TO DEVOTE MYSELF ENTIRELY TO THE STUDY OF THE FRENCH LANGUAGE 
lbi-3729-6852-0042 I AM A VERY UNPLEASANT PUPIL ALWAYS ASKING QUESTIONS CURIOUS TROUBLESOME INSATIABLE AND EVEN SUPPOSING THAT I COULDN'T MEET WITH A TEACHER I REQUIRE I AM AFRAID I AM NOT RICH ENOUGH TO PAY HIM 
lbi-3729-6852-0043 I RESIDE IN THEM AVAY GREW DEDUCE PORT 
lbi-3729-6852-0044 I WILL MAKE YOU TRANSLATE THEM INTO FRENCH AND YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID OF MY FINDING YOU INSATIABLE 
lbi-3729-6852-0045 HE HAD A GOOD APPETITE COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WITHOUT LAUGHING WAS CELEBRATED FOR HIS WITTY REPARTEE HASAN HIS SOCIABLE MANNERS BUT HE SPENT HIS LIFE AT HOME SELDOM GOING OUT AND SEEING HARDLY ANYONE BECAUSE HE ALWAYS HAD A PIPE IN HIS MOUTH AND WAS SURROUNDED BY AT LEAST TWENTY CATS WITH WHICH HE WOULD AMUSE HIMSELF ALL DAY 
lbi-3729-6852-0046 HIS HOUSEKEEPER HAD THE MANAGEMENT OF EVERYTHING SHE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO BE IN NEED OF ANYTHING AND SHE GAVE NO ACCOUNT OF HIS MONEY WHICH SHE KEPT ALTOGETHER BECAUSE HE NEVER ASKED HER TO RENDER ANY ACCOUNTS 
lbi-4077-13751-0000 ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS WAS FORMALLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE 
lbi-4077-13751-0001 ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION 
lbi-4077-13751-0002 INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY AFFILIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TODAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS 
lbi-4077-13751-0003 IN PLACE OF A SINGLE HAMLET IN THE SMALLEST CORNER OF WHICH THE MEMBERS COULD HAVE CONGREGATED THERE NOW ARE ABOUT SEVENTY STAKES OF ZION AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED ORGANIZED WARDS EACH WARD AND STAKE WITH ITS FULL COMPLEMENT OF OFFICERS AND PRIESTHOOD ORGANIZATIONS 
lbi-4077-13751-0004 THE PRACTICE OF GATHERING ITS PROSELYTES INTO ONE PLACE PREVENTS THE BUILDING UP AND STRENGTHENING AFFORD BRANCHES AND INASMUCH AS EXTENSIVE AND STRONG ORGANIZATIONS ARE SELDOM MET WITH ABROAD VERY ERRONEOUS IDEAS EXIST CONCERNING THE STRENGTH OF THE CHURCH 
lbi-4077-13751-0005 NEVERTHELESS THE MUSTARD SEED AMONG THE SMALLEST OF ALL SEEDS HAS ATTAINED THE PROPORTIONS OF A TREE AND THE BIRDS OF THE AIR ARE NESTLING IN ITS BRANCHES THE ACORN IS NOW AN OAK OFFERING PROTECTION AND THE SWEETS OF SATISFACTION TO EVERY EARNEST PILGRIM JOURNEYING ITS WAY FOR TRUTH 
lbi-4077-13751-0006 THEIR EYES WERE FROM THE FIRST TURNED IN ANTICIPATION TOWARD THE EVENING SOME NOT MERELY THAT THE WORK OF PROSELYTING SHOULD BE CARRIED ON IN THE WEST BUT THAT THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE CHURCH SHOULD BE THERE ESTABLISHED 
lbi-4077-13751-0007 THE BOOK OF MORMON HAD TAUGHT THE PEOPLE THE TRUE ORIGIN AND DESTINY OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS AND TOWARD THIS THICK SKINNED REMNANT OF A ONCE MIGHTY PEOPLE THE MISSIONARIES OF MORMONISM EARLY TURNED THEIR EYES AND WITH HER EYES WHEN TO THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR HOPES 
lbi-4077-13751-0008 IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE CAREFULLY REGARDED THEIR RELIGION OF THE LATTER DAY SAINTS WITH FAVOUR SEEING IN THE BOOK OF MORMON STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS 
lbi-4077-13751-0009 THE FIRST WELL ESTABLISHED SEAT OF THE CHURCH WAS IN THE PRETTY LITTLE TOWN OF KIRTLAND OHIO ALMOST WITHIN SIGHT OF LAKE ERIE IN HERE SOON ROSE THE FIRST TEMPLE OF MODERN TIMES 
lbi-4077-13751-0010 TO THE SERVANT LIGHTED A SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY 
lbi-4077-13751-0011 SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES OF MISERY INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTER BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISSOURIANS 
lbi-4077-13751-0012 THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LILBURN W BOGGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MORMON HATER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFESTS HIS SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTORS 
lbi-4077-13751-0013 THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FITLY CHRONICLE BY HUMAN SCRIBE 
lbi-4077-13751-0014 MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE RIVER MOST OF THE REFUGEES FOUND SHELTER AMONG THE MORE HOSPITABLE PEOPLE OF CLAY COUNTY AND AFTERWARD ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN CALDWELL COUNTY THERE IN FOUNDING THE CITY OF FAR WEST 
lbi-4077-13751-0015 A SMALL SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN FOUNDED BY MORMON FAMILIES ON SHOAL CREEK AND HERE ON THE THIRTIETH OF OCTOBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT A COMPANY OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FELL UPON THE HAPLESS SETTLERS AND BUTCHERED A SCORE 
lbi-4077-13751-0016 BE IT SAID TO THE HONOR OF SOME OF THE OFFICERS INTRUSTED WITH A TERRIBLE COMMISSION THAT WHEN THEY LEARNED ITS TRUE SIGNIFICANCE THEY RESIGN THEIR AUTHORITY RATHER THAN HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THEY DESIGNATED A COLD BLOODED BUTCHERY 
lbi-4077-13751-0017 OH WHAT A RECORD TO READ WHAT A PICTURE TO GAZE UPON HOW AWFUL THE FACT 
lbi-4077-13751-0018 AMERICAN SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ALBIGENSES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PAPAL LEGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY OF THE ODE WAS HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE 
lbi-4077-13751-0019 WHO BEGAN THE QUARREL WAS OF THE MORMONS 
lbi-4077-13751-0020 AS A SAMPLE OF THE PRESS COMMENTS AGAINST THE BRUTALITY OF THE ASSYRIANS I QUOTE A PARAGRAPH FROM THE QUINCY ARGUS MARCH SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE 
lbi-4077-13751-0021 IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISERY WITH GOVERNOR BOGGS AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INCITED TO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVES OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE 
lbi-4077-13754-0000 THE ARMY FOUND THE PEOPLE IN POVERTY AND LEFT THEM IN COMPARATIVE WEALTH 
lbi-4077-13754-0001 BUT A WORD FURTHER CONCERNING THE EXPEDITION IN GENERAL 
lbi-4077-13754-0002 IT WAS THROUGH FLOYD'S ADVICE THAT BUCHANAN ORDERED THE MILITARY EXPEDITION TO UTAH OSTENSIBLY TO INSTALL CERTAIN FEDERAL OFFICIALS AND TO REPRESS AN ALLEGED INFANTADO REBELLION WHICH IN FACT HAD NEVER COME INTO EXISTENCE BUT IN REALITY TO FURTHER THE INTERESTS OF THE SECESSIONISTS 
lbi-4077-13754-0003 MOREOVER HAD THE PEOPLE BEEN INCLINED TO REBELLION WAS GREATER OPPORTUNITY COULD HAVE WISHED 
lbi-4077-13754-0004 ALREADY A NORTH AND A SOUTH WERE TALKED OF WENT ON SET UP ALSO A WEST 
lbi-4077-13754-0005 THEY KNEW NO NORTH NO SOUTH NO EAST NO WEST THEY STOOD POSITIVELY BY THE CONSTITUTION AND WOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO IN THE BLOODY STRIFE BETWEEN BROTHERS UNLESS INDEED THEY WERE SUMMONED BY THE AUTHORITY TO WHICH THEY HAD ALREADY ONCE LOYALLY RESPONDED TO FURNISH MEN IN ARMS FOR THE COUNTRY'S NEED 
lbi-4077-13754-0006 WHAT THE LATTER DAY SAINTS CALL CELESTIAL MARRIAGE IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CHURCH AND IS IN VERY GENERAL PRACTICE BUT OF CELESTIAL MARRIAGE PLURALITY OF WIVES WAS AN INCIDENT NEVER AND ESSENTIAL 
lbi-4077-13754-0007 WE BELIEVE IN A LITERAL RESURRECTION AND AN ACTUAL HEREAFTER IN WHICH FUTURE STATE SHALL BE RECOGNISED EVERY SANCTIFIED IT AUTHORIZED RELATIONSHIP EXISTING HERE ON EARTH OF PARENT AND CHILD BROTHER AND SISTER HUSBAND AND WIFE 
lbi-4077-13754-0008 IT HAS BEEN MY PRIVILEGE TO TREAD THE SOIL OF MANY LANDS TO OBSERVE THE CUSTOMS AND STUDY THE HABITS OF MORE NATIONS THAT ONE AND I'VE YET TO FIND THE PLACE AND MEET THE PEOPLE WHERE AND WITH WHOM THE PURITY OF MAN AND WOMAN IS HELD MORE PRECIOUS THAN AMONG THE ALLIED MORMONS IN THE MOUNTAIN VALLEYS OF THE WEST 
lbi-4077-13754-0009 AT THE INCEPTION OF BURL MARRIAGE AMONG THE LATTER DAY SAINTS THERE WAS NO LAW NATIONAL OR STATE AGAINST HIS PRACTICE 
lbi-4077-13754-0010 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO A LAW WAS ENACTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF SUPPRESSING PLURAL MARRIAGE AND AS HAD BEEN PREDICTED IN THE NATIONAL SENATE PRIOR TO ITS PASSAGE IT LAY FOR MANY YEARS A DEAD LETTER 
lbi-4077-13754-0011 FEDERAL JUDGES AND UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS IN UTAH WHO ARE NOT MORMONS NOR LOVERS OF MORMONISM REFUSED TO ENTERTAIN COMPLAINTS OR PROSECUTE CASES UNDER THE LAW BECAUSE OF ITS MANIFEST INJUSTICE AND INADEQUACY 
lbi-4077-13754-0012 THIS MEANT THAT FOR AN ALLEGED MISDEMEANOR FOR WHICH CONGRESS PRESCRIBED A MAXIMUM PENALTY OF SIX MONTHS IMPRISONMENT AND A FINE OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MAN MIGHT BE IMPRISONED FOR LIFE EYE FOR MANY TERMS OF A MAN'S NATURAL LIFE TO THE COURT'S POWER TO ENFORCE ITS SENTENCES EXTEND SO FAR AND MAYBE FIND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
lbi-4077-13754-0013 BEFORE THIS TRAVESTY ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF LAW COULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THERE MET WITH THE REVERSAL AND REBUKE IT DESERVED MEN WERE IN PRISON UNDER SENTENCE OF MANY YEARS DURATION 
lbi-4077-13754-0014 THE PEOPLE CONTESTED THESE MEASURES ONE BY ONE IN THE COURTS PRESENTING IN CASE AFTER CASE THE DIFFERENT PHASES OF THE SUBJECT AND URGING THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE MEASURE 
lbi-4077-13754-0015 THEN THE CHURCH WAS DIS INCORPORATED AND ITS PROPERTY BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL CONFISCATED AND ESCHEATED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALTHOUGH THEIR PERSONAL PROPERTY WAS SOON RESTORED WE'LL ESTATE OF GREAT VALUE LONG LAY IN THE HANDS OF THE COURTS RECEIVER AND THE MORMON CHURCH HAD TO PAY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT HIGH RENTAL ON ITS OWN PROPERTY 
lbi-4077-13754-0016 AND SO THE STORY OF MORMONISM RUNS ON ITS FINALE HAS NOT YET BEEN WRITTEN THE CURRENT PRESS PRESENTS CONTINUOUSLY NEW STAGES OF ITS PROGRESS NEW DEVELOPMENTS OF ITS PLAN 
lbi-4446-2271-0000 MAIN HALL LIKED ALEXANDER BECAUSE HE WAS AN ENGINEER 
lbi-4446-2271-0001 HE HAD PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT EVERYTHING AND HIS IDEA ABOUT AMERICANS WAS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENGINEERS AND MECHANICS 
lbi-4446-2271-0002 IT'S TREMENDOUSLY WELL PUT ON TOO 
lbi-4446-2271-0003 IT'S BEEN ON ONLY TWO WEEKS AND I'VE BEEN HALF A DOZEN TIMES ALREADY 
lbi-4446-2271-0004 DO YOU KNOW ALEXANDER MAIN HALL LOOKED WITH PERPLEXITY UP TO THE TOP OF THE HANSOM AND RUBBED HIS PINK CHEEK WITH HIS GLOVED FINGER DO YOU KNOW I SOMETIMES THINK OF TAKING TO CRITICISM SERIOUSLY MYSELF 
lbi-4446-2271-0005 SHE SAVES HER HAND TOO SHE'S AT HER BEST IN THE SECOND ACT 
lbi-4446-2271-0006 HE'S BEEN WANTING TO MARRY HILDA IS THREE YEARS AND MORE 
lbi-4446-2271-0007 SHE DOESN'T TAKE UP WITH ANYBODY YOU KNOW 
lbi-4446-2271-0008 I REMEMBER GOING ONE OF HER FAMILY TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE THAT THERE WAS A ROMANCE SOMEWHERE BACK IN THE BEGINNING 
lbi-4446-2271-0009 MEYNELL VOUCHED FOR HER CONSTANCY WITH A LOFTINESS THAT MADE ALEXANDER SMILE EVEN WHILE A KIND OF RAPID EXCITEMENT WAS TINGLING THROUGH HIM 
lbi-4446-2271-0010 HE'S ANOTHER WHO'S AWFULLY KEEN ABOUT HER LET ME INTRODUCE YOU 
lbi-4446-2271-0011 SIR HARRY TOWN MISTER BARTLEY ALEXANDER THE AMERICAN ENGINEER 
lbi-4446-2271-0012 I SAY SAID HARRY THE LITTLE GIRLS GOING FAMOUSLY TO NIGHT ISN'T SHE 
lbi-4446-2271-0013 YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THE DANCE OF THE CONSCIOUS TONIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME 
lbi-4446-2271-0014 WEST MERE I WENT BACK AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND WE THOUGHT SHE SEEMED QUITE UNCERTAIN OF HERSELF 
lbi-4446-2271-0015 A LITTLE ATTACK OF NERVES POSSIBLY 
lbi-4446-2271-0016 HE WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL A KEEN INTEREST IN A SLENDER BAREFOOT DONKEY GIRL WHO SLIPPED IN AND OUT OF THE CLAY SINGING LIKE SOMEONE WINDING THROUGH A HILLY FIELD 
lbi-4446-2271-0017 ONE NIGHT WHEN HE AND WINIFRED WERE SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BRIDGE HE TOLD OF THINGS HAD HAPPENED WHILE HE WAS STUDYING ABROAD THAT HE WAS SORRY FOR ONE THING IN PARTICULAR AND HE ASKED HER WHETHER SHE THOUGHT SHE OUGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THEM 
lbi-4446-2271-0018 SHE CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT AND ANSWERED NO I THINK NOT THOUGH I AM GLAD YOU ASKED ME 
lbi-4446-2271-0019 AFTER THAT IT WAS EASY TO FORGET ACTUALLY TO FORGET 
lbi-4446-2271-0020 OF COURSE HE REFLECTED SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT COMBINATION OF SOMETHING HOMELY AND SENSIBLE AND SOMETHING UTTERLY WILD AND DAFT 
lbi-4446-2271-0021 SHE MUST CARE ABOUT THE THEATRE A GREAT DEAL MORE THAN SHE USED TO 
lbi-4446-2271-0022 I'M GLAD SHE'S HELD OUR OWN SENSE 
lbi-4446-2271-0023 AFTER ALL WE WERE AWFULLY LONG 
lbi-4446-2271-0024 I SHOULDN'T WONDER IF SHE COULD LAUGH ABOUT IT WITH ME NOW 
lbi-4446-2273-0000 HILDA WAS VERY NICE TO HIM AND HE SAT ON THE EDGE OF HIS CHAIR FLUSHED WITH HIS CONVERSATIONAL EFFORTS AND MOVING HIS CHIN ABOUT NERVOUSLY OVER HIS HIGH COLLAR 
lbi-4446-2273-0001 THEY ASKED HIM TO COME TO SEE THEM IN CHELSEA AND THEY SPOKE VERY TENDERLY OF HILDA 
lbi-4446-2273-0002 LAMB WOULDN'T CARE A GREAT DEAL ABOUT MANY OF THEM I FANCY 
lbi-4446-2273-0003 WHEN BARTLEY ARRIVED AT BEDFORD SQUARE ON SUNDAY EVENING MARIE THE PRETTY LITTLE FRENCH GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR AND CONDUCTED HIM UPSTAIRS 
lbi-4446-2273-0004 I SHOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED YOU IF MOLLIE HAD BEEN HERE FOR I REMEMBER YOU DON'T LIKE ENGLISH COOKERY 
lbi-4446-2273-0005 I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE YET TO TELL YOU WHAT A JOLLY LITTLE PLACE I THINK THIS IS 
lbi-4446-2273-0006 THEY ARE ALL SKETCHES MADE ABOUT THE VILLA D'ESTE YOU SEE 
lbi-4446-2273-0007 THOSE FELLOWS ARE ALL VERY LOYAL EVEN MAIN HALL 
lbi-4446-2273-0008 I'VE MANAGED TO SAVE SOMETHING EVERY YEAR AND THAT WITH HELPING MY THREE SISTERS NOW AND THEN AND TIDING POOR COUSIN MICHAEL OF BAD SEASONS 
lbi-4446-2273-0009 IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY RARE SHE SAID BUT SOME OF IT WAS MY MOTHER'S 
lbi-4446-2273-0010 THERE WAS WATER CRESS SOUP IN SOUL AND A DELIGHTFUL OMELET STUFFED WITH MUSHROOMS AND TRUFFLES AND TWO SMALL RARE DUCKLINGS AND ARTICHOKES AND A DRY YELLOW RHONE WINE OF WHICH BARTLEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN VERY FOND 
lbi-4446-2273-0011 THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT LOOKED SO JOLLY 
lbi-4446-2273-0012 THANK YOU BUT I DON'T LIKE IT SO WELL AS THIS 
lbi-4446-2273-0013 HAVE YOU BEEN IN PARIS MUCH THESE LATE YEARS 
lbi-4446-2273-0014 THERE ARE A FEW CHANGES IN THE OLD QUARTER 
lbi-4446-2273-0015 DON'T I THOUGH I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR IT HOW DID HER SON TURNED OUT 
lbi-4446-2273-0016 HER HAIR IS STILL LIKE FLAX AND HER BLUE EYES ARE JUST LIKE A BABY'S AND SHE HAS THE SAME THREE FRECKLES ON HER LITTLE NOSE AND TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO OUR BAND A MARE 
lbi-4446-2273-0017 HOW JOLLY IT WAS BEING YOUNG HILDA 
lbi-4446-2273-0018 DO YOU REMEMBER THAT FIRST WALK WE TOOK TOGETHER IN PARIS 
lbi-4446-2273-0019 COME WE'LL HAVE OUR COFFEE IN THE OTHER ROOM AND YOU CAN SMOKE 
lbi-4446-2273-0020 I THINK WE DID SHE ANSWERED DEMURELY 
lbi-4446-2273-0021 WHAT SHE WANTED FROM US WAS NEITHER FLOWERS NOR OUR FRANKS BUT JUST OUR YOUTH 
lbi-4446-2273-0022 THEY WERE BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE 
lbi-4446-2273-0023 THE STRANGE WOMAN AND HER PASSIONATE SENTENCE THAT RANG OUT SO SHARPLY HAD FRIGHTENED THEM BOTH 
lbi-4446-2273-0024 BARTLEY STARTED WHEN HILDA RANG A LITTLE BELL BESIDE HER DEAR ME WHY DID YOU DO THAT 
lbi-4446-2273-0025 IT WAS VERY JOLLY HE MURMURED LAZILY AS MARIE CAME IN TO TAKE AWAY THE COFFEE 
lbi-4446-2273-0026 HAVE I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY NEW PLAY 
lbi-4446-2273-0027 WHEN SHE FINISHED ALEXANDER SHOOK HIMSELF OUT OF A REVERIE 
lbi-4446-2273-0028 NONSENSE OF COURSE I CAN'T REALLY SAYING EXCEPT THE WAY MY MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER DID BEFORE ME 
lbi-4446-2273-0029 IT'S REALLY TOO WARM IN THIS ROOM TO SING DON'T YOU FEEL IT 
lbi-4446-2273-0030 ALEXANDER WENT OVER AND OPENED THE WINDOW FOR HER 
lbi-4446-2273-0031 THERE JUST IN FRONT 
lbi-4446-2273-0032 HE STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND HER AND TRIED TO STEADY HIMSELF AS HE SAID IT'S SOFT AND MISTY SEE HOW WHITE THE STARS ARE 
lbi-4446-2273-0033 FOR A LONG TIME NEITHER HILDA NOR BARTLEY SPOKE 
lbi-4446-2273-0034 HE FELT A TREMOR RUN THROUGH THE SLENDER YELLOW FIGURE IN FRONT OF HIM 
lbi-4446-2273-0035 BARTLEY LEANED OVER HER SHOULDER WITHOUT TOUCHING HER AND WHISPERED IN HER EAR YOU ARE GIVING ME A CHANCE YES 
lbi-4446-2273-0036 ALEXANDER CLINCH THE TWO HANDS AT HIS SIDES 
lbi-4446-2275-0000 THE STOP AT QUEENSTOWN THE TEDIOUS PASSAGE UP THE MERSEY WERE THINGS THAT HE NOTED DIMLY THROUGH HIS GROWING IMPATIENCE 
lbi-4446-2275-0001 SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS 
lbi-4446-2275-0002 ALEXANDER PACED UP AND DOWN THE HALLWAY BUTTONING AND UNBUTTONING HIS OVERCOAT UNTIL SHE RETURNED AND TOOK HIM UP TO HILDA'S LIVING ROOM 
lbi-4446-2275-0003 THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED 
lbi-4446-2275-0004 ALEXANDER DID NOT SIT DOWN 
lbi-4446-2275-0005 I FELT IT IN MY BONES WHEN I WOKE THIS MORNING THAT SOMETHING SPLENDID WAS GOING TO TURN UP 
lbi-4446-2275-0006 I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE SISTER CATER COUSIN MIKE WOULD BE HAPPENING ALONG 
lbi-4446-2275-0007 SHE PUSHED HIM TOWARD THE BIG CHAIR BY THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEARTH HER KNEES DRAWN UP TO HER CHIN LAUGHING LIKE A HAPPY LITTLE GIRL 
lbi-4446-2275-0008 WHY DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD 
lbi-4446-2275-0009 I GOT IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO 
lbi-4446-2275-0010 ALEXANDER LEANED FORWARD AND WARMED HIS HANDS BEFORE THE BLAZE 
lbi-4446-2275-0011 BARTLEY BENT LOWERED OVER THE FIRE 
lbi-4446-2275-0012 SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH 
lbi-4446-2275-0013 I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY 
lbi-4446-2275-0014 I CAN'T STAND SEEING YOU MISERABLE 
lbi-4446-2275-0015 HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY 
lbi-4446-2275-0016 HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM THE CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES IT 
lbi-4446-2275-0017 BUT IT'S WORSE NOW IT'S UNBEARABLE 
lbi-4446-2275-0018 I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER 
lbi-4446-2275-0019 THE WORLD IS ALL THERE JUST AS IT USED TO BE BUT I CAN'T GET AT IT ANY MORE 
lbi-4446-2275-0020 IT WAS MYSELF I WAS DEFYING HILDA 
lbi-4446-2275-0021 HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN 
lbi-4446-2275-0022 BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME WHEN YOU WERE HERE IN THE SUMMER 
lbi-4446-2275-0023 ALEXANDER GROANED I MEANT TO BUT SOMEHOW I COULDN'T 
lbi-4446-2275-0024 SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY INGRATITUDE 
lbi-4446-2275-0025 WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL 
lbi-4446-2275-0026 SHE CLOSED HER EYES AND TOOK A DEEP BREATH AS IF TO DRAW IN AGAIN THE FRAGRANCE OF THOSE DAYS 
lbi-4446-2275-0027 HE MOVED UNEASILY IN HIS CHAIR CREAKED 
lbi-4446-2275-0028 YES YES SHE HURRIED PULLING HER HAND GENTLY AWAY FROM HIM 
lbi-4446-2275-0029 PLEASE TELL ME ONE THING PARTLY AT LEAST TELL ME THAT YOU BELIEVE I THOUGHT I WAS MAKING YOU HAPPY 
lbi-4446-2275-0030 YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY 
lbi-4446-2275-0031 I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG 
lbi-4446-2275-0032 BUT I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'VE ONLY TO TELL ME NOW 
lbi-4446-2275-0033 WHAT I MEAN IS THAT I WANT YOU TO PROMISE NEVER TO SEE ME AGAIN NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I COME NO MATTER HOW HARD I BEG 
lbi-4446-2275-0034 KEEP AWAY IF YOU WISH WHEN HAVE I EVER FOLLOW YOU 
lbi-4446-2275-0035 ALEXANDER ROSE AND SHOOK HIMSELF ANGRILY YES I KNOW I'M COWARDLY 
lbi-4446-2275-0036 HE TOOK HER ROUGHLY IN HIS ARMS DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN 
lbi-4446-2275-0037 HOPE BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO 
lbi-4446-2275-0038 I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING 
lbi-4446-2275-0039 I MUST KNOW ABOUT YOU 
lbi-4446-2275-0040 THE SIGHT OF YOU PARTLY TO SEE YOU LIVING AND HAPPY AND SUCCESSFUL CAN I NEVER MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME 
lbi-4446-2275-0041 YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT 
lbi-4446-2275-0042 AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE 
lbi-4446-2275-0043 BARTLEY BENT OVER AND TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS KISSING HER MOUTH THAN HER WET TIRED EYES 
lbi-4446-2275-0044 DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED 
lbi-4446-2275-0045 WITH TORTURED EACH OTHER ENOUGH FOR TONIGHT 
lbi-4507-16021-0000 CHAPTER ONE ORIGIN 
lbi-4507-16021-0001 ITALIAN GENDERS A WHOLE WORLD LO PAGA FOR WHICH READ THEFT AND A HELL LOVE PEG GRIN FOR WHICH READ HUNGER 
lbi-4507-16021-0002 THUS IDLENESS IS THE MOTHER 
lbi-4507-16021-0003 SHE HAS A SON THEFT AND A DAUGHTER HUNGER 
lbi-4507-16021-0004 WHAT IS SLANG 
lbi-4507-16021-0005 WE HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THIS SORT OF OBJECTIONS 
lbi-4507-16021-0006 SLANG IS ODIOUS 
lbi-4507-16021-0007 SLANG MAKES ONE SHUDDER 
lbi-4507-16021-0008 WHO DENIES THAT OF COURSE IT DOES 
lbi-4507-16021-0009 WHEN IT IS A QUESTION OF PROBING A WOUND A GOAL A SOCIETY SINCE WHEN HAS IT BEEN CONSIDERED WRONG TO GO TOO FAR TO GO TO THE BOTTOM 
lbi-4507-16021-0010 WE HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS SOMETIMES A COURAGEOUS ACT AND AT LEAST IS SIMPLE AND USEFUL DEED WORTHY OF THE SYMPATHETIC ATTENTION WHICH DUTY ACCEPTED UNFULFILLED MERITS 
lbi-4507-16021-0011 WHY SHOULD ONE NOT EXPLORE EVERYTHING AND STUDY EVERYTHING 
lbi-4507-16021-0012 WHY SHOULD ONE HALT ON THE WAY 
lbi-4507-16021-0013 NOTHING IS MORE LUGUBRIOUS THAN THE CONTEMPLATION THUS IN ITS NUDITY IN THE BROAD LIGHT OF THOUGHT OF THE HORRIBLE SWARMING OF SLANG 
lbi-4507-16021-0014 NOW WHEN AS HORROR EVER EXCLUDED STUDY 
lbi-4507-16021-0015 SINCE WHEN HAS MALADY BANISHED MEDICINE 
lbi-4507-16021-0016 CAN ONE IMAGINE A NATURALIST REFUSING TO STUDY THE VIPER THE BAT THE SCORPION THE CENTIPEDE THE TARANTULA AND ONE WHO WOULD CAST THEM BACK INTO THEIR DARKNESS SAYING OH HOW UGLY THAT IS 
lbi-4507-16021-0017 HE WOULD BE LIKE A PHILOLOGIST REFUSING TO EXAMINE A FACT IN LANGUAGE A PHILOSOPHER HESITATING TO SCRUTINIZE A FACT INHUMANITY 
lbi-4507-16021-0018 WHAT IS SLANG PROPERLY SPEAKING 
lbi-4507-16021-0019 IT IS THE LANGUAGE OF WRETCHEDNESS 
lbi-4507-16021-0020 WE MAY BE STOPPED THE FACT MAY BE PUT TO US IN GENERAL TERMS WHICH IS ONE WAY OF ATTENUATING IT WE MAY BE TOLD THAT ALL TRADES PROFESSIONS IT MAY BE ADDED ALL THE ACCIDENTS OF THE SOCIAL HIERARCHY AND ALL FORMS OF INTELLIGENCE HAVE THEIR OWN SLANG 
lbi-4507-16021-0021 THE PAINTER WHO SAYS MY GRINDER THE NOTARY WHO SAYS MY SKIP OF THE GUTTER THE HAIR DRESSER WHO SAYS MY MEALY BACK THE COBBLER WHO SAYS MY CUB TALKS SLANG 
lbi-4507-16021-0022 THERE IS THE SLAYING OF THE AFFECTED LADY AS WELL AS OF THE PRESS USES 
lbi-4507-16021-0023 THE SUGAR MANUFACTURER WHO SAYS LOAF CLARIFIED LUMPS BASTARD COMMON BURNT THIS HONEST MANUFACTURER TALK SLANG 
lbi-4507-16021-0024 ALGEBRA MEDICINE BOTANY HAVE EACH THEIR SLANG 
lbi-4507-16021-0025 TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS CONFLICT WRETCHEDNESS HAS INVENTED A NEW LANGUAGE OF COMBAT WHICH IS SLANG 
lbi-4507-16021-0026 TO KEEP AFLOAT AND TO RESCUE FROM OBLIVION TO HOLD ABOVE THE GULF WHERE IT BUT A FRAGMENT OF SOME LANGUAGE WHICH MAN HAS SPOKEN AND WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE LOST THAT IS TO SAY ONE OF THE ELEMENTS GOOD OR BAD OF WHICH CIVILIZATION IS COMPOSED ARE BY WHICH IT IS COMPLICATED TO EXTEND THE RECORDS OF SOCIAL OBSERVATION IS TO SERVE CIVILIZATION ITSELF 
lbi-4507-16021-0027 PHOENICIAN VERY GOOD 
lbi-4507-16021-0028 EVEN DIALECT LET THAT PASS 
lbi-4507-16021-0029 TO THIS WE REPLY AND ONE WORD ONLY 
lbi-4507-16021-0030 ASSUREDLY IF THE TONGUE WHICH A NATION OR A PROVINCE HAS SPOKEN IS WORTHY OF INTEREST THE LANGUAGE WHICH HAS BEEN SPOKEN BY A MISERY IS TILL MORE WORTHY OF ATTENTION AND STUDY 
lbi-4507-16021-0031 AND THEN WE INSIST UPON IT THE STUDY OF SOCIAL DEFORMITIES AND INFIRMITIES AND THE TASK OF POINTING THEM OUT WITH A VIEW TO REMEDY IS NOT A BUSINESS IN WHICH CHOICE IS PERMITTED 
lbi-4507-16021-0032 HE MUST DESCEND WITH HIS HEART FULL OF CHARITY AND SEVERITY AT THE SAME TIME AS A BROTHER AND AS A JUDGE TO THOSE IMPENETRABLE CASEMATES WHERE CRAWL PELL MELL THOSE WHO BELIEVED AND THOSE WHO DEAL THE BLOW THOSE WHO WEEP AND THOSE WHO CURSE THOSE WHO FAST IN THOSE WHO DEVOUR THOSE WHO ENDURE EVIL AND THOSE WHO INFLICTED 
lbi-4507-16021-0033 DO WE REALLY KNOW THE MAN TOO WELL WHEN WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED WITH THE CAVERN 
lbi-4507-16021-0034 THEY CONSTITUTE TWO DIFFERENT ORDERS OF FACTS WHICH CORRESPOND TO EACH OTHER WHICH ARE ALWAYS INTERLACED AND WHICH OFTEN BRING FORTH RESULTS 
lbi-4507-16021-0035 TRUE HISTORY BEING A MIXTURE OF ALL THINGS THE TRUE HISTORIAN MINGLES IN EVERYTHING 
lbi-4507-16021-0036 FACTS FOR ONE OF THESE AND IDEAS THE OTHER 
lbi-4507-16021-0037 THERE IT CLOTHES ITSELF IN WORD MASKS IN METAPHOR RAGS 
lbi-4507-16021-0038 IN THIS GUISE IT BECOMES HORRIBLE 
lbi-4507-16021-0039 ONE PERCEIVES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING IT A HIDEOUS MURMUR SOUNDING ALMOST LIKE HUMAN ACCENTS BUT MORE NEARLY RESEMBLING A HOWL THAN AN ARTICULATE WORD 
lbi-4507-16021-0040 ONE THINKS ONE HEARS HYDRAS TALK 
lbi-4507-16021-0041 IT IS UNINTELLIGIBLE IN THE DARK 
lbi-4507-16021-0042 IT IS BLACK AND MISFORTUNE IT IS BLACKER STILL AND CRIME THESE TWO BLACKNESSES AMALGAMATED COMPOSE SLANG 
lbi-4507-16021-0043 THE EARTH IS NOT DEVOID OF RESEMBLANCE TO A JAIL 
lbi-4507-16021-0044 LOOK CLOSELY AT LIFE 
lbi-4507-16021-0045 IT IS SO MADE THAT EVERYWHERE WE FEEL THE SENSE OF PUNISHMENT 
lbi-4507-16021-0046 EACH DAY HAS ITS OWN GREAT GRIEF FOR IT'S LITTLE I CARE 
lbi-4507-16021-0047 YESTERDAY YOU WERE TREMBLING FREE HEALTH THAT IS DEAR TO YOU TO DAY YOU FEAR FOR YOUR OWN TOMORROW IT WILL BE ANXIETY ABOUT MONEY THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW THE DIATRIBES OF A SLANDERER THE DAY AFTER THAT THE MISFORTUNE OF SOME FRIEND THEN THE PREVAILING WEATHER THEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN BROKEN OR LOST THEN A PLEASURE WITH WHICH YOUR CONSCIENCE AND YOUR VERTEBRAL COLUMN REPROACH YOU AGAIN THE COURSE OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS 
lbi-4507-16021-0048 THIS WITHOUT RECKONING IN THE PAINS OF THE HEART AND SO IT GOES ON 
lbi-4507-16021-0049 THERE IS HARDLY ONE DAY OUT OF A HUNDRED WHICH IS WHOLLY JOYOUS AND SUNNY 
lbi-4507-16021-0050 AND YOU BELONG TO THAT SMALL CLASS WHO ARE HAPPY 
lbi-4507-16021-0051 IN THIS WORLD'S EVIDENTLY THE VESTIBULE OF ANOTHER THERE ARE NO FORTUNATE 
lbi-4507-16021-0052 THE REAL HUMAN DIVISION IS THIS THE LUMINOUS AND THE SHADY 
lbi-4507-16021-0053 TO DIMINISH THE NUMBER OF THE SHADY TO AUGMENT THE NUMBER OF VOLUMINOUS THAT IS THE OBJECT 
lbi-4507-16021-0054 THAT IS WHY WE CRY EDUCATION SCIENCE 
lbi-4507-16021-0055 TO TEACH READING MEANS TO LIGHT THE FIRE EVERY SYLLABLE SPELLED OUT SPARKLES 
lbi-4507-16021-0056 HOWEVER HE WHO SAYS LIGHT DOES NOT NECESSARILY SAY JOY 
lbi-4507-16021-0057 PEOPLE SUFFERING LIGHT EXCESS BURNS 
lbi-4507-16021-0058 THE FLAME IS THE ENEMY OF THE WING 
lbi-4507-16021-0059 TO BURN WITHOUT CEASING TO FLY THEREIN LIES THE MARVEL OF GENIUS 
lbi-1188-133604-0000 YOU WILL FIND ME CONTINUALLY SPEAKING OF FOUR MEN TITIAN HOLBEIN TURNER AND TINTORET IN ALMOST THE SAME TERMS 
lbi-1188-133604-0001 THEY UNITE EVERY QUALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REFERRING TO THEM AS COLORISTS SOMETIMES AS CURIOUS CURISTS 
lbi-1188-133604-0002 BY BEING STUDIOUS OF COLOR THEY ARE STUDIOUS OF DIVISION AND WHILE THE CURIOUS CURIOUS DEVOTES HIMSELF TO THE REPRESENTATION OF DEGREES OF FORCE IN ONE THING UNSEPARATED LIGHT A COLORIST HAVE FOR THEIR FUNCTION THE ATTAINMENT OF BEAUTY BY ARRANGEMENT OF THE DIVISIONS OF LIGHT 
lbi-1188-133604-0003 MY FIRST AND PRINCIPAL REASON WAS THAT THEY ENFORCED BEYOND ALL RESISTANCE ON ANY STUDENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO COPY THEM THIS METHOD OF LAYING PORTIONS OF DISTINCT HUE SIDE BY SIDE 
lbi-1188-133604-0004 SOME OF THE TOUCHES INDEED WHEN THE TINT HAS BEEN MIXED WITH MUCH WATER HAD BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DROPS OR PONDS SO THAT THE PIGMENT MIGHT CRYSTALLIZE HARD AT THE EDGE 
lbi-1188-133604-0005 DOES THE HEAD OF A PARROT WITH A LITTLE FLOUR IN HIS BEAK FROM A PICTURE OF CARPACCIO'S ONE OF A SERIES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GEORGE 
lbi-1188-133604-0006 THEN HE COMES TO SPEAK OF IT 
lbi-1188-133604-0007 THE BROWN GROUND BENEATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOUCH OF BLACK IS PUT FOR THE HOLLOW TOO DELICATE LINES OF DARK GRAY DEFINED THE OUTER CURVE AND ONE LITTLE QUIVERING TOUCH OF WHITE DRAWS THE INNER EDGE OF THE MANDIBLE 
lbi-1188-133604-0008 FOR BELIEVE ME THE FINAL PHILOSOPHY OF ART CAN ONLY RATIFY THEIR OPINION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A COCK ROBIN IS TO BE READ AND OF A GRASS PLOT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SKILL OF ART ISN'T INSTANTLY SEIZING ON THE MANIFOLD DELICIOUSNESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SEES BY PRECISION OF INSTANTANEOUS TOUCH 
lbi-1188-133604-0009 NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUDIES AT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS ENCLOSED PROPERLY AND HARMONIZE WITH THE OTHER HUES THEY BECOME SOMEHOW MORE PRECIOUS AND PEARLY IN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OVEN TREATED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE DIAMONDS AND THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL THOSE JEWELS IF THEIR GRADATED JUSTLY 
lbi-1188-133604-0010 BUT IN THIS VIGNETTE COPIED FROM TURNER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCIPALS BROUGHT OUT PERFECTLY 
lbi-1188-133604-0011 THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORKS THAN I NO EXISTING DEPENDENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUBDUED TONES THEIR FAVORITE CHOICE AND TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DAWN OR TWILIGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHTEST SUNSETS PRODUCED CHIEFLY OUT OF GREY PAPER 
lbi-1188-133604-0012 IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COLORLESS WILL USE HIS UTMOST FORCE OF COLOR AS A SINGER HAS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LOUD OR LOW THE VIRTUES IN BOTH CASES ALWAYS IN REFINEMENT NEVER IN LOUDNESS 
lbi-1188-133604-0013 IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER 
lbi-1188-133604-0014 DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOTHIC SCHOOLS AN EASY ONE 
lbi-1188-133604-0015 THE LAW OF THE SCHOOLS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEARLY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MISTER FAINTNESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHTFUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INTRODUCTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELEMENTARY PRACTICE OF PAINTING EVERY STUDY ON A GOLDEN GROUND 
lbi-1188-133604-0016 THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELLERS WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES 
lbi-1188-133604-0017 THAT ASTYAGES RESTRAINED OR SEVERE DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ERRONEOUS 
lbi-1188-133604-0018 IN ALL EARLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART 
lbi-1188-133604-0019 THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH UNFAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL 
lbi-1188-133604-0020 BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION 
lbi-1188-133604-0021 IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE 
lbi-1188-133604-0022 YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CONQUER HIM WITH WHAT SCATHE YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM 
lbi-1188-133604-0023 THE COLORISTS AS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PARQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN AS THE QUESTION CAN I RUN HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGING AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME 
lbi-1188-133604-0024 NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER 
lbi-1188-133604-0025 YOU KNOW I'VE JUST BEEN TELLING YOU HOW THE SCHOOL MATERIALISM IN CLAY INVOLVED ITSELF AT LAST IN CLOUD AND FIRE 
lbi-1188-133604-0026 HERE IS AN EQUALLY TYPICAL GREEK SCHOOL LANDSCAPE BY WILSON LOST WHOLLY IN GOLDEN MIST THE TREES SO SLIGHTLY DRAWN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE TREES WERE TOWERS AND NO CARE FOR COLOUR WHATSOEVER PERFECTLY DECEPTIVE IN MARVELLOUS EFFECT OF SUNSHINE THROUGH A MIST APOLLO IN THE PARTHENON 
lbi-1188-133604-0027 NOW HERE'S RAPHAEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL THE BEAUTIFUL NEST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE 
lbi-1188-133604-0028 WELL THEN LAST HERE'S TURNER'S GREEK SCHOOL OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND YOU DEFINE HIS ART ABSOLUTELY AS FIRST THE DISPLAYING INTENSELY AND WITH THE STERNEST INTELLECT OF NATURAL FORM AS IT IS AND THEN THE ENVELOPMENT OF IT WITH CLOUD AND FIRE 
lbi-1188-133604-0029 ONLY THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF CLOUD AND FIRE 
lbi-1188-133604-0030 HE KNOWS THEM BOTH 
lbi-1188-133604-0031 THERE'S ONE AND THERE'S ANOTHER THE DUDLEY AND THE FLINT 
lbi-1188-133604-0032 IT IS ONLY A PENCIL OUTLINE BY EDWARD BURNE JONES AND ILLUSTRATION IN THE STORY OF PSYCHE IT IS THE INTRODUCTION OF PSYCHE AFTER ALL HER TROUBLES INTO HEAVEN 
lbi-1188-133604-0033 EVERY PLANT IN THE GRASSES SET FORMALLY GROWS PERFECTLY AND MAYBE REALIZED COMPLETELY 
lbi-1188-133604-0034 EXQUISITE ORDER AND UNIVERSAL WITH ETERNAL LIFE AND LIGHT THIS IS THE FAITH AND EFFORT OF THE SCHOOLS OF CRYSTAL AND YOU MAY DESCRIBE AND COMPLETE THEIR WORK QUITE LITERALLY BY TAKING ANY VERSES OF CHAUCER IN HIS TENDER MOOD AND OBSERVING HOW HE INSISTS ON THE CLEARNESS AND BRIGHTNESS FIRST AND THEN ON THE ORDER 
lbi-1188-133604-0035 THUS IN CHAUCER'S DREAM 
lbi-1188-133604-0036 IN BOTH THESE HIGH MYTHICAL SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING NATURE THOUGH SUFFERING IS STILL DIGNIFIED AND BEAUTIFUL 
lbi-1188-133604-0037 EVERY LINE IN WHICH THE MASTER TRACES IT EVEN WERE SEEMINGLY NEGLIGENT AS LOVELY AND SAT DOWN WITH A MEDITATIVE CALMNESS WHICH MAKES THESE TWO ETCHINGS CAPABLE OF BEING PLACED BESIDE THE MOST TRANQUIL WORK OF HOLBEIN OR DURE 
lbi-1188-133604-0038 BUT NOW HERE IS A SUBJECT OF WHICH YOU WILL WONDER AT FIRST WHY TURNER DREW IT AT ALL 
lbi-1188-133604-0039 IT HAS NO BEAUTY WHATSOEVER NO SPECIALTY OF PICTURESQUENESS AND ALL ITS LINES ARE CRAMPED AND POOR 
lbi-1188-133604-0040 THE QUAINTNESS AND POVERTY ARE ALL INTENDED 
lbi-1188-133604-0041 IT IS A GLEANER BRINGING DOWN HER ONE SHEAF OF CORN TO AN OLD WATER MILL ITSELF MOSSY AND RENT SCARCELY ABLE TO GET ITS STONES TO TURN 
lbi-1188-133604-0042 THE SCENE IS ABSOLUTELY ARCADIAN 
lbi-1188-133604-0043 SEE THAT YOUR LIFE HAS BEEN NOTHING WORSE THAN A BOY'S CLIMBING FIRS ENTANGLED KITE 
lbi-1188-133604-0044 IT WILL BE WELL FOR YOU IF YOU JOIN NOT WITH THOSE WHO INSTEAD OF KITES FLY FALCONS WHO INSTEAD OF OBEYING THE LAST WORDS OF THE GREAT CLOUD SHEPHERD TO FEED HIS SHEEP LIVE THE LIVES HOW MUCH LESS THAN VANITY OF THE WERE WOLF IN THE GEAR EAGLE

lbi-4970-29093-0004 HE WAS UNABLE TO DECIDE EXACTLY WHAT IT SHOULD BE 
lbi-4970-29093-0005 SOMETIMES HE THOUGHT HE WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN A CONSPICIOUS PULPIT AND HUMBLY PREACHED THE GOSPEL OF REPENTANCE AND IT EVEN CROSSED HIS MIND THAT IT WOULD BE NOBLE TO GIVE HIMSELF TO A MISSIONARY LIFE TO SOME BENIGHTED REGION WHERE THE DATE PALM GROVES AND THE NIGHTINGALES VOICE IS IN TUNE AND THE BOBOLINK SINGS ON THE OFF NIGHTS 
lbi-4970-29093-0006 WAS IT SEEMED TO HIM WELL ENOUGH AS A SCIENCE BUT HE NEVER COULD DISCOVER A PRACTICAL CASE WHERE IT APPEARED TO HIM WORTH WHILE TO GO TO LAW AND ALL THE CLIENTS WHO STOP WITH THIS NEW CLERK AND THE ANTE ROOM OF THE WAR OFFICE WHERE HE WAS WRITING PHILIP INVARIABLY ADVISED TO SETTLE NO MATTER HOW BUT SETTLE GREATLY TO THE DISGUST OF HIS EMPLOYER WHO KNEW THAT JUSTICE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN COULD ONLY BE ATTAINED BY THE RECOGNIZED PROCESSES WITH THE ATTENDANT BEADS 
lbi-4970-29093-0007 IT IS SUCH A NOBLE AMBITION THAT IT IS A PITY IT HAS USUALLY SUCH A SHALLOW FOUNDATION 
lbi-4970-29093-0008 HE WANTED TO BEGIN AT THE TOP OF THE LADDER 
lbi-4970-29093-0009 PHILIP THEREFORE READ DILIGENTLY IN THE ASTOR LIBRARY PLANNED LITERARY WORKS THAT SHOULD COMPEL ATTENTION AND NURSED HIS GENIUS 
lbi-4970-29093-0010 HE HAD NO FRIEND WISE ENOUGH TO TELL HIM TO STEP INTO THE DORKING CONVENTION THEN IN SESSION MAKE A SKETCH OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE PLATFORM AND TAKE IT TO THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY GRAPE VINE AND SEE WHAT HE COULD GET A LINE FOR IT 
lbi-4970-29093-0011 OH VERY WELL SAID GRINGO TURNING AWAY WITH A SHADE OF CONTEMPT YOU'LL FIND IF YOU ARE GOING INTO LITERATURE A NEWSPAPER WORK THAT YOU CAN AFFORD A CONSCIENCE LIKE THAT 
lbi-4970-29093-0012 BUT PHILIP DID AFFORD IT AND HE WROTE THANKING HIS FRIENDS AND DECLINING BECAUSE HE SAID THE POLITICAL SCHEME WOULD FAIL AND OUGHT TO FAIL 
lbi-4970-29093-0013 AND HE WENT BACK TO HIS BOOKS AND WHO IS WAITING FOR AN OPENING LARGE ENOUGH FOR HIS DIGNIFIED ENTRANCE INTO THE LITERARY WORLD 
lbi-4970-29093-0014 WELL I'M GOING AS AN ENGINEER YOU COULD GO AS ONE 
lbi-4970-29093-0015 YOU CAN BEGIN BY CARRYING A ROD AND PUTTING DOWN THE FIGURES 
lbi-4970-29093-0016 NO IT'S NOT TOO SOON 
lbi-4970-29093-0017 I'M READY TO GO ANYWHERE FOR SIX MONTHS 
lbi-4970-29093-0018 THE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE BY THIS TIME FULL OF THE ADVENTURE WENT DOWN TO THE WALL STREET OFFICE OF HENRY'S UNCLE AND HAD A TALK WITH THAT WILY OPERATOR 
lbi-4970-29093-0019 THE NIGHT WAS SPENT IN PACKING UP AND WRITING LETTERS FOR PHILIP WOULD NOT TAKE SUCH AN IMPORTANT STEP WITHOUT INFORMING HIS FRIENDS 
lbi-4970-29093-0020 WHY IT'S A MISERY SOMEWHERE ON THE FRONTIER I THINK WE'LL GET A MAP 
lbi-4970-29093-0021 I WAS AFRAID IT WAS NEARER HOME 
lbi-4970-29093-0022 HE KNEW HIS UNCLE WOULD BE GLAD TO HEAR THAT HE HAD AT LAST TURNED HIS THOUGHTS TO A PRACTICAL MATTER 
lbi-4970-29093-0023 HE WELL KNEW THE PERILS OF THE FRONTIER THE SAVAGE STATE OF SOCIETY THE LURKING INDIANS AND THE DANGERS OF FEVER 
lbi-4970-29095-0000 SHE WAS TIRED OF OTHER THINGS 
lbi-4970-29095-0001 SHE TRIED THIS MORNING AN AIR OR TWO UPON THE PIANO SANG A SIMPLE SONG IN A SWEET BUT SLIGHTLY METALLIC VOICE AND THEN SEATING HERSELF BY THE OPEN WINDOW READ PHILIP'S LETTER 
lbi-4970-29095-0002 WELL MOTHER SAID THE YOUNG STUDENT LOOKING UP WITH A SHADE OF IMPATIENCE 
lbi-4970-29095-0003 I HOPE THESE TOLD THE ELDERS THAT FATHER AND I ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PIANO AND THAT MUCH AS HE LOVES MUSIC THESE NEVER IN THE ROOM WHEN IT IS PLAYED 
lbi-4970-29095-0004 I HEARD FATHER TELL COUSIN ABNER THAT HE WAS WHIPPED SO OFTEN FOR WHISTLING WHEN HE WAS A BOY THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE WHAT COMPENSATION HE COULD GET NOW 
lbi-4970-29095-0005 THY WAYS GREATLY TRY ME RUTH AND ALL THY RELATIONS 
lbi-4970-29095-0006 IS THY FATHER WILLING THEY SHOULD GO AWAY TO A SCHOOL OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE 
lbi-4970-29095-0007 I HAVE NOT ASKED HIM RUTH REPLIED WITH A LOOK THAT MIGHT IMPLY THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE DETERMINED LITTLE BODIES WHO FIRST MADE UP HER OWN MIND AND THEN COMPELLED OTHERS TO MAKE A BEAR'S IN ACCORDANCE WITH HERS 
lbi-4970-29095-0008 MOTHER I AM GOING TO STUDY MEDICINE 
lbi-4970-29095-0009 MARGARET BOLTON ALMOST LOST FOR A MOMENT HER HABITUAL PLACIDITY 
lbi-4970-29095-0010 THE STUDY MEDICINE 
lbi-4970-29095-0011 DOES THEE THINK THEE COULD STAND IT SIX MONTHS 
lbi-4970-29095-0012 AND BESIDES SUPPOSE HE DOES LEARN MEDICINE 
lbi-4970-29095-0013 I WILL PRACTISE IT 
lbi-4970-29095-0014 WEAR THEE AND THY FAMILY ARE NO 
lbi-4970-29095-0015 IF I CAN GET PATIENCE 
lbi-4970-29095-0016 RUTH SAT QUITE STILL FOR A TIME WITH FACE INTENT AND FLUSHED IT WAS OUT NOW 
lbi-4970-29095-0017 THE SIGHTSEERS RETURNED IN HIGH SPIRITS FROM THE CITY 
lbi-4970-29095-0018 RUTH ASKED THE ENTHUSIASTS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN SUCH A SOUNDING MUZZLE HIM WITH ITS GREAT HALLS AND ECHOING ROOMS AND NO COMFORTABLE PLACE IN IT FOR THE ACCOMMODATION OF ANY BODY 
lbi-4970-29095-0019 AND THEN THERE WAS BROADSTREET 
lbi-4970-29095-0020 THERE CERTAINLY WAS NO END TO IT AND EVEN RUTH WAS PHILADELPHIAN ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT A STREET OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ANY END OR ARCHITECTURAL BLIGHT UPON WHICH THE WEARY EYE COULD REST 
lbi-4970-29095-0021 BUT NEITHER SAINT GERARD NOR BROADSTREET NEITHER WONDERS OF THE MEN NOR THE GLORIES OF THE HALL WHERE THE GHOSTS OF OUR FATHERS SIT ALWAYS SIGNING THE DECLARATION IMPRESSED THE VISITORS SO MUCH AS THE SPLENDORS OF THE CHESTNUT STREET WINDOWS AND THE BARGAINS ON EIGHTH STREET 
lbi-4970-29095-0022 IS THE GOING TO THE YEARLY MEETING RUTH ASKED ONE OF THE GIRLS 
lbi-4970-29095-0023 I HAVE NOTHING TO WEAR REPLIED THAT DEMURE PERSON 
lbi-4970-29095-0024 IT HAS OCCUPIED MOTHER A LONG TIME TO FIND THE SHOPS THE EXACT SHADE FOR HER NEW BONNET 
lbi-4970-29095-0025 AND THE OLD GOAT WHY SHOULD I 
lbi-4970-29095-0026 IF I GO TO MEETING AT ALL I LIKE BEST TO SIT IN THE QUIET OLD HOUSE IN GERMANTOWN WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE ALL OPEN AND I CAN SEE THE TREES AND HEAR THE STIR OF LEAVES 
lbi-4970-29095-0027 IT'S SUCH A CRUSH AT THE YEARLY MEETING AT ARCH STREET AND THEN THERE'S THE ROW OF SLEEK LOOKING YOUNG MEN WHO LINED THE CURB STONE AND SEPARATE US AS WE COME OUT 
lbi-4970-29095-0028 HE DOESN'T SAY THAT IT'S ON THE FRONTIER AND ON THE MAP EVERY THING BEYOND IT IS MARKED INDIANS AND DESERT AND LOOKS AS DESOLATE AS A WOMAN'S A MEETING WHOSE DEATH IT WAS TIME FOR HIM TO DO SOMETHING 
lbi-4970-29095-0029 IS HE GOING TO START A DAILY NEWSPAPER AMONG THE KICKAPOOS 
lbi-4970-29095-0030 FATHER THESE UNJUST TO PHILIP HE'S GOING INTO BUSINESS 
lbi-4970-29095-0031 HE DOESN'T SAY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS SAID RUTH A LITTLE DUBIOUSLY BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT LAND AND RAILROADS AND THE NOSE FATHER THAT FORTUNES ARE MADE NOBODY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW IN A NEW COUNTRY 
lbi-4970-29095-0032 THAT PHILIP IS HONEST AND HE HAS TALENT ENOUGH IF HE WILL STOP SCRIBBLING TO MAKE HIS WAY 
lbi-4970-29095-0033 LET A BOX WOMEN ARE PUT INTO MEASURED FOR IT AND PUTTING YOUNG IF WE GO ANYWHERE IT'S IN A BOX VEILED AND PINIONED AND SHUT IN BY DISABILITY 
lbi-4970-29095-0034 WHY SHOULD I REST AND BE STUPID AND SIT IN ACTION BECAUSE I AM A GIRL 
lbi-4970-29095-0035 AND IF I HAD A FORTUNE WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAD A USELESS LIFE 
lbi-4970-29095-0036 HAS THE CONSULTED THY MOTHER ABOUT A CAREER I SUPPOSE IT IS A CAREER OF THESE WANTS 
lbi-4970-29095-0037 BUT THAT WISE AND PLACID WOMAN UNDERSTOOD THE SWEET REBEL A GREAT DEAL BETTER THAN RUTH UNDERSTOOD HERSELF 
lbi-4970-29095-0038 RUTH WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT PHILIP HAD MADE A PUSH INTO THE WORLD AND SHE WAS SURE THAT HIS TALENT AND COURAGE WOULD MAKE A WAY FOR HIM 
lbi-4992-23283-0000 BUT THE MORE FORGETFULNESS HAD THEN PREVAILED THE MORE POWERFUL WAS THE FORCE OF REMEMBRANCE WHEN SHE AWOKE 
lbi-4992-23283-0001 MISS MILNER'S HEALTH IS NOT GOOD 
lbi-4992-23283-0002 SAID MISSUS HORTON A FEW MINUTES AFTER 
lbi-4992-23283-0003 SO THERE IS TO ME ADDED SANFORD WITH A SARCASTIC SNEER 
lbi-4992-23283-0004 AND YET YOU MUST OWN HER BEHAVIOUR HAS WARRANTED THEM HAS IT NOT BEEN IN THIS PARTICULAR INCOHERENT AND UNACCOUNTABLE 
lbi-4992-23283-0005 NOT THAT I KNOW OF NOT ONE MORE THAT I KNOW OF HE REPLIED WITH ASTONISHMENT AT WHAT SHE HAD INSINUATED AND YET WITH A PERFECT ASSURANCE THAT SHE WAS IN THE WRONG 
lbi-4992-23283-0006 PERHAPS I AM MISTAKEN ANSWERED SHE 
lbi-4992-23283-0007 TO ASK ANY MORE QUESTIONS OF YOU I BELIEVE WOULD BE UNFAIR 
lbi-4992-23283-0008 HE SEEMED TO WAIT FOR HER REPLY BUT AS SHE MADE NONE HE PROCEEDED 
lbi-4992-23283-0009 OH MY LORD CRIED MISS WOODLEY WHEN A MOST FORCIBLE ACCENT YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH SHE WOULD PARDON ME FOR INTERESTING 
lbi-4992-23283-0010 BUT IN SUCH A CASE MISS MILNER SELECTION OF A HUSBAND SHALL NOT DIRECT MINE 
lbi-4992-23283-0011 IF SHE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO ESTIMATE HER OWN VALUE I DO 
lbi-4992-23283-0012 INDEPENDENT OF HER FORTUNE SHE HAS BEAUTY TO CAPTIVATE THE HEART OF ANY MAN AND WITH ALL HER FOLLIES SHE HAS A FRANKNESS IN HER MANNER AN UNAFFECTED WISDOM IN HER THOUGHTS OF VIVACITY IN HER CONVERSATION AND WITH ALL A SOFTNESS IN HER DEMEANOR THAT MIGHT ALONE ENGAGE THE AFFECTIONS OF A MAN OF THE NICEST SENTIMENTS AND THE STRONGEST UNDERSTANDING 
lbi-4992-23283-0013 MY LORD MISS MILLER'S TASTE DOES NOT A DEPRAVED ONE IT IS BUT TOO REFINED 
lbi-4992-23283-0014 WHAT CAN YOU MEAN BY THAT MISS WOODLEY YOU TALK MYSTERIOUSLY 
lbi-4992-23283-0015 IS SHE NOT AFRAID THAT I WILL THWART HER INCLINATIONS 
lbi-4992-23283-0016 AGAIN HE SEARCHED HIS OWN THOUGHTS NOR INEFFECTUALLY AS BEFORE 
lbi-4992-23283-0017 MISS WOODLEY WAS TOO LITTLE VERSED IN THE SUBJECT TO KNOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT TO LOVE AT ALL AT LEAST NOT TO THE EXTENT OF BREAKING THROUGH ENGAGEMENTS AND ALL THE VARIOUS OBSTACLES THAT STILL MITIGATED AGAINST THEIR UNION 
lbi-4992-23283-0018 TO RELIEVE HER FROM BOTH HE LAID HIS HAND WITH FORCE UPON HIS HEART AND SAID DO YOU BELIEVE ME 
lbi-4992-23283-0019 I WILL MAKE NO UNJUST USE OF WHAT I KNOW HE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS I BELIEVE YOU MY LORD 
lbi-4992-23283-0020 I HAVE NEVER YET HOWEVER BEEN VANQUISHED BY THEM AND EVEN UPON THIS OCCASION MY REASON SHALL COMBAT THEM TO THE LAST AND MY REASON SHALL FAIL ME BEFORE I DO WRONG 
lbi-4992-41797-0000 YES DEAD THESE FOUR YEARS AND A GOOD JOB FOR HER TOO 
lbi-4992-41797-0001 WELL AS I SAY IT'S AN AWFUL QUEER WORLD THEY CLAP ALL THE BURGLARS IN JAIL AND THE MURDERERS AND THE LIKE PETERS I ALLERS THOUGHT A GENTLE REPROOF WOULD BE ENOUGH PUNISHMENT FOR A WIFE BEATER CARS HE PROBABLY HAS A LOT OF PROVOCATION THAT NOBODY KNOWS AND FIREBUGS CAN'T THINK OF THE RIGHT NAME SOMETHING LIKE SENDING FAIRIES AND THE BREAKERS OF THE PEACE AND WHAT NOT AND YET THE LAW HAS NOTHING TO SAY TO A MAN LIKE HIM LORD 
lbi-4992-41797-0002 GRANDFATHER WAS ALEXANDER CARRIE L L D DOCTOR OF LAWS THAT IS 
lbi-4992-41797-0003 MISTER POPPLE LAID DOWN HIS BRUSH 
lbi-4992-41797-0004 AS SWAIN TO MAN HE EJACULATED IF HE DON'T WORK HARD YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES DOCTOR OF LAWS 
lbi-4992-41797-0005 DAWN HE AIN'T DONE A THING HE ORDERS SINCE HE WAS BORN 
lbi-4992-41797-0006 HE KEEPS THE THOU SHALT NOT COMMANDMENTS FOR STRAY HEN LORD DOES 
lbi-4992-41797-0007 HE GAVE UP HIS POSITION AND SHUT THE FAMILY UP IN THAT GEM OF A HOUSE SO HE COULD STUDY HIS BOOKS 
lbi-4992-41797-0008 MISTER POPE OF EXAGGERATED NOTHING BUT ON THE CONTRARY LEFT MUCH UNSAID IN HIS NARRATIVE OF THE FAMILY AT THE HOUSE OF LORDS 
lbi-4992-41797-0009 HENRY LORD WITH THE DEGREE OF PH D TO HIS CREDIT HAD BEEN PROFESSOR OF ZOOLOGY AT A NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE BUT HAD RESIGNED HIS POST IN ORDER TO WRITE A SERIES OF SCIENTIFIC TEXT BOOKS 
lbi-4992-41797-0010 ALWAYS IRRITABLE COLD INDIFFERENT HE HAD GROWN RAPIDLY MORE SO AS YEARS WENT ON 
lbi-4992-41797-0011 WHATEVER APPEALED TO HER SENSE OF BEAUTY WAS STRAIGHTWAY TRANSFERRED TO PAPER OR CANVAS 
lbi-4992-41797-0012 SHE IS WILD TO KNOW HOW TO DO THINGS 
lbi-4992-41797-0013 SHE MAKES EFFORT AFTER EFFORT TREMBLING WITH EAGERNESS AND WHEN SHE FAILS TO REPRODUCE WHAT SHE SEES SHE WORKS HERSELF INTO A FRENZY OF GRIEF AND DISAPPOINTMENT 
lbi-4992-41797-0014 WHEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE A RABBIT OR A BIRD LOOK REAL ON PAPER SHE SEARCHED IN HER FATHER'S BOOKS OR PICTURES OF ITS BONES 
lbi-4992-41797-0015 CYRIL THERE MUST BE SOME BETTER WAY OF DOING I JUST DRAW THE OUTLINE OF AN ANIMAL AND THEN I PUT HAIRS OR FEATHERS ON IT THEY HAVE NO BODIES 
lbi-4992-41797-0016 THEY COULDN'T RUN HER MOOD THERE JUST PASTEBOARD 
lbi-4992-41797-0017 HE WOULDN'T SEARCH SO DON'T WORRY REPLIES CYRIL QUIETLY AND THE TWO LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND KNEW THAT IT WAS SO 
lbi-4992-41797-0018 THERE IN THE CEDAR HOLLOW THEN LIVED OLIVE LOWERED AND ANGRY RESENTFUL LITTLE CREATURE WEIGHED DOWN BY A FIERCE SENSE OF INJURY 
lbi-4992-41797-0019 OLIVE'S MOURNFUL BLACK EYES MET NANCY'S SPARKLING BROWN ONES 
lbi-4992-41797-0020 NANCY'S CURLY CHESTNUT CROP SHONE IN THE SUN AND OLIVE'S THICK BLACK PLAITS LOOKED BLACKER BY CONTRAST 
lbi-4992-41797-0021 SHE IS WONDERFUL MORE WONDERFUL THAN ANYBODY WE'VE EVER SEEN ANYWHERE AND SHE DRAWS BETTER THAN A TEACHER IN CHARLES TOWN 
lbi-4992-41797-0022 SHE'S OLDER THAN I AM BUT SO TINY AND SAD AND SHY BUT SHE SEEMS LIKE A CHILD 
lbi-4992-41806-0000 NATTY HARMON TRIED THE KITCHEN PUMP SECRETLY SEVERAL TIMES DURING THE EVENING FOR THE WATER HAD RUN UPHILL ALL THE WAY FROM THE WELL TO THE KITCHEN SINK AND HE BELIEVED THIS TO BE A CONTINUAL MIRACLE THAT MIGHT GIVE OUT AT ANY MOMENT 
lbi-4992-41806-0001 TONIGHT THERE WAS NO NEED OF EXTRA HEAT AND THERE WERE GREAT CEREMONIES TO BE OBSERVED IN LIGHTING FIRES ON THE HEARTH STONES 
lbi-4992-41806-0002 THEY BEGAN WITH THE ONE IN THE FAMILY SITTING ROOM COLONEL WHEELER RALPH THURSTON MISTER AND MISSUS BILL HARMON WITH NATTY AND REFERS MISTER AND MISSUS POPHAM WITH DIGNITY AND LALLY JOY ALL STANDING ADMIRING GROUPS AND THRILLING WITH DELIGHT AT THE ORDER OF EVENTS 
lbi-4992-41806-0003 KATHLEEN WAVED THE TORCH TO AND FRO AS SHE RECITED SOME BEAUTIFUL LINES WRITTEN FOR SOME SUCH PURPOSE AS THAT WHICH CALLED THEM TOGETHER TO NIGHT 
lbi-4992-41806-0004 BURN FIRE BURN FLICKER FLICKER FLAME 
lbi-4992-41806-0005 NEXT CAME OLIVE'S TURNED TO HELP IN THE CEREMONIES 
lbi-4992-41806-0006 RALPH THURSTON HAD FOUND A LINE OF LATIN FOR THEM IN HIS BELOVED HORACE TO BE SPLENDID FOCUS FOR YOU THE HEARTH FIRE SHINES 
lbi-4992-41806-0007 OLIVE HAD PAINTED MOTTO ON A LONG NARROW PANEL OF CANVAS AND GIVING IT TO MISTER POPHAM STOOD BY THE FIRESIDE WHILE HE DEFTLY FITTED IT INTO THE PLACE PREPARED FOR IT 
lbi-4992-41806-0008 OLIVE HAS ANOTHER LOVELY GIFT FOR THE YELLOW HOUSE SAID MOTHER CAREY RISING AND TO CARRY OUT THE NEXT PART OF THE PROGRAMME WE SHALL HAVE TO GO IN PROCESSION UPSTAIRS TO MY BEDROOM 
lbi-4992-41806-0009 EXCLAIMED BILL HEARKENED TO HIS WIFE AS THEY WENT THROUGH THE LIGHTED HALL 
lbi-4992-41806-0010 AIN'T THEY THE GREATEST 
lbi-4992-41806-0011 MOTHER CAREY POURED COFFEE NANCY CHOCOLATE AND THE OTHERS HELPED SERVE THE SANDWICHES AND CAKE DOUGHNUTS AND TARTS 
lbi-4992-41806-0012 AT THAT MOMENT THE GENTLEMAN ENTERED BEARING A HUGE OBJECT CONCEALED BY A PIECE OF GREEN FELT 
lbi-4992-41806-0013 APPROACHING THE DINING TABLE HE CAREFULLY PLACED THE ARTICLE IN THE CENTRE AND REMOVE THE CLOTH 
lbi-4992-41806-0014 THINKS I TO MYSELF I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING OSH POPHAM GOOD MEN IF WE TOOK TIME ENOUGH A GLUE ENOUGH SO I CARRIED THIS LITTLE FELLER HOW IN A BUSHEL BASKET ONE NIGHT LAST MONTH AND I'VE SPENT ELEVEN EVENIN'S PUT HIM TOGETHER 
lbi-4992-41806-0015 MISSUS HARMON THOUGHT HE SANG TOO MUCH AND TOLD HER HUSBAND PRIVATELY THAT IF HE WAS A CANARY BIRD SHE SHOULD WANT TO KEEP A TABLE COVER A RESULT MOST OF THE TIME BUT HE WAS IMMENSELY POPULAR WITH THE REST OF HIS AUDIENCE 
lbi-4992-41806-0016 THE FACE OF A MAHOGANY SHONE WITH DELIGHT AND WHY NOT WHEN IT WAS DOING EVERYTHING ALMOST EVERYTHING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF A PIANO AND YET THE FAMILY HAD ENJOYED WEEKS OF GOOD NOURISHING MEALS ON WHAT HAD BEEN SAVED BY ITS EXERTIONS 
lbi-4992-41806-0017 WE SHUT OUR EYES THE FLOWERS BLOOM ON WE MURMUR ABOUT THE CORNERS PHIL WE CHOOSE THE SHADOW BUT THE SUN THAT CAST IT SHINES BEHIND US STILL 
lbi-5105-28233-0000 LENGTH OF SERVICE FOURTEEN YEARS THREE MONTHS AND FIVE DAYS 
lbi-5105-28233-0001 HE SEEMED BORN TO PLEASE WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF THE POWER HE POSSESSED 
lbi-5105-28233-0002 IT MUST BE OWNED AND NO ONE WAS MORE READY TO CONFESS IT THAN HIMSELF THAT HIS LITERARY ATTAINMENTS WERE BY NO MEANS OF A HIGH ORDER 
lbi-5105-28233-0003 WE DON'T SPIN TOPS IS A FAVORITE SAYING AMONGST ARTILLERY OFFICERS INDICATING THAT THEY DO NOT SHIRK THEIR DUTY BY FRIVOLOUS PURSUITS BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT SERVICE THAT BEING NATURALLY IDLE WAS VERY MUCH GIVEN TO SPINNING TOPS 
lbi-5105-28233-0004 ONCE IN ACTION HE WAS LEAVING A DETACHMENT OF INFANTRY THROUGH AN INTRENCHMENT 
lbi-5105-28233-0005 SOMETIMES HE WOULD WANDER ON FOOT UPON THE SANDY SHORE AND SOMETIMES HE WOULD ENJOY A RIDE ALONG THE SUMMIT OF THE CLIFF ALTOGETHER BEING IN NO HURRY AT ALL TO BRING HIS TASK TO AN END 
lbi-5105-28233-0006 NO CATHEDRAL UNEVEN BURGOS ITSELF COULD VIE WITH THE CHURCH AT MONT MARTRE 
lbi-5105-28233-0007 BEN SERFS MOST AMBITIOUS DESIRE WAS TO INDUCE THE CAPTAIN TO GO WITH HIM AND END HIS DAYS IN HIS MUCH LOVED HOME AND SO INCESSANTLY WERE SERVANT ACTS EARS BESIEGED WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE UNPARALLELED BEAUTIES AND ADVANTAGES OF THIS EIGHTEENTH ARE ON DE SIMILE OF PARIS THAT HE COULD SCARCELY HEAR THE NAME OF MONT MARTRE WITHOUT A CONSCIOUS THRILL OF AVERSION 
lbi-5105-28233-0008 WHEN A PRIVATE IN THE EIGHTH CAVALRY HE HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF QUITTING THE ARMY AT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS OF AGE BUT UNEXPECTEDLY HE HAD BEEN APPOINTED ORDERLY TO CAPTAIN SERVE A DECK 
lbi-5105-28233-0009 THE BOND OF UNION THUS EFFECTED COULD NEVER BE SEVERED AND ALTHOUGH BENDS ITS ACHIEVEMENTS HAD FAIRLY EARNED HIM THE RIGHT OF RETIREMENT HE FIRMLY DECLINED ALL HONORS OR ANY PENSION THAT MIGHT PART HIM FROM HIS SUPERIOR OFFICER 
lbi-5105-28233-0010 UNLIKE HIS MASTER HE MADE NO PRETENSION TO ANY GIFT OF POETIC POWER BUT HIS INEXHAUSTIBLE MEMORY MADE HIM A LIVING ENCYCLOPAEDIA AND FOR HIS STOCK OF ANECDOTES AND TROOPERS TALES HE WAS MATCHLESS 
lbi-5105-28240-0000 FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM SERVE ATTACK HAD MADE HIS WAY TO THE TOP OF THE CLIFF 
lbi-5105-28240-0001 IT WAS QUITE TRUE THAT A VESSEL WAS IN SIGHT HARDLY MORE THAN SIX MILES FROM THE SHORE BUT OWING TO THE INCREASE IN THE EARTH'S CONVEXITY AND THE CONSEQUENT LIMITATION OF THE RANGE OF VISION THE RIGGING OF THE TOP MASTS ALONE WAS VISIBLE ABOVE THE WATER 
lbi-5105-28240-0002 EXCLAIMED SERVISS BACK KEEPING HIS EYE UNMOVED AT HIS TELESCOPE 
lbi-5105-28240-0003 SHE IS UNDER SAIL BUT SHE IS COUNTED HIM A CHEF'S YACHT HE WAS RIGHT 
lbi-5105-28240-0004 IF THE COUNT WERE ON BOARD A STRANGE FATALITY WAS BRINGING HIM TO THE PRESENCE OF HIS RIVAL 
lbi-5105-28240-0005 HE RECKONED THEREFORE NOT ONLY UPON ASCERTAINING THE EXTENT OF THE LATE CATASTROPHE BUT UPON LEARNING ITS CAUSE 
lbi-5105-28240-0006 THE WIND BEING ADVERSE THE DOMINA DID NOT MAKE VERY RAPID PROGRESS BUT AS THE WEATHER IN SPITE OF A FEW CLOUDS REMAINED CALM AND THE SEA WAS QUITE SMOOTH AND SHE WAS ENABLED TO HOLD A STEADY COURSE 
lbi-5105-28240-0007 SERV ATTACK TOOK IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE ARENA WAS ENDEAVORING TO PUT IN 
lbi-5105-28240-0008 A NARROW CHANNEL FORMED A PASSAGE THROUGH THE RIDGE OF ROCKS THAT PROTECTED IT FROM THE OPEN SEA AND WHICH EVEN IN THE ROUGHEST WEATHER WOULD INSURE THE CALMNESS OF ITS WATERS 
lbi-5105-28240-0009 SLIGHTLY CHANGING HER COURSE SHE FIRST STRUCK HER MAINSAIL AND IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENTS OF HER HELMSMAN SOON CARRIED NOTHING BUT HER TWO TOPSAILS BRIGANTINE AND JIB 
lbi-5105-28240-0010 CAPTAIN SURVEY DECK HASTENED TOWARD HIM 
lbi-5105-28240-0011 I LEFT YOU ON A CONTINENT AND HERE I HAVE THE HONOUR OF FINDING YOU ON AN ISLAND 
lbi-5105-28240-0012 NEVER MIND NOW INTERPOSED THE CAPTAIN WE WILL TALK OF THAT BY AND BY 
lbi-5105-28240-0013 NOTHING MORE THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELF 
lbi-5105-28240-0014 ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THIS IS THE MEDITERRANEAN 
lbi-5105-28240-0015 FOR SOME MOMENTS HE SEEMED PERFECTLY STUPIFIED AND THEN RECOVERING HIMSELF HE BEGAN TO OVERWHELM THE COUNT WITH A TORRENT OF QUESTIONS 
lbi-5105-28240-0016 TO ALL THESE INQUIRIES THE COUNT RESPONDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE 
lbi-5105-28240-0017 SOME MYSTERIOUS FORCE SEEMED TO HAVE BROUGHT ABOUT A CONVULSION OF THE ELEMENTS 
lbi-5105-28240-0018 YOU WILL TAKE ME ON BOARD COUNT WILL YOU NOT 
lbi-5105-28240-0019 MY YACHT IS AT YOUR SERVICE SIR EVEN SHOULD YOU REQUIRE TO MAKE A TOUR AROUND THE WORLD 
lbi-5105-28240-0020 THE COUNT SHOOK HIS HEAD 
lbi-5105-28240-0021 BEFORE STARTING IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT THE ENGINE OF THE DEBRIS NAY SHOULD BE REPAIRED TO SAIL UNDER CANVAS ONLY WOOD AND CONTRARY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS BE BOTH TEDIOUS AND DIFFICULT 
lbi-5105-28240-0022 IT WAS ON THE LAST DAY OF JANUARY THAT THE REPAIRS OF THE SCHOONER WERE COMPLETED 
lbi-5105-28240-0023 A SLIGHT DIMINUTION IN THE EXCESSIVELY HIGH TEMPERATURE WHICH HAD PREVAILED FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS WAS THE ONLY APPARENT CHANGE IN THE GENERAL ORDER OF THINGS BUT WHETHER THIS WAS TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ALTERATION IN THE EARTH'S ORBIT WAS A QUESTION WHICH WOULD STILL REQUIRE SEVERAL DAYS TO DECIDE 
lbi-5105-28240-0024 DOUBTS NOW AROSE AND SOME DISCUSSION FOLLOWED WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS DESIRABLE FOR BEN'S IF TO ACCOMPANY HIS MASTER 
lbi-5105-28241-0000 HER SEA GOING QUALITIES WERE EXCELLENT AND WOULD HAVE AMPLY SUFFICED FOR CIRCUMNAVIGATION OF THE GLOBE 
lbi-5105-28241-0001 AFTER AN APPRENTICESHIP ON A MERCHANT SHIP HAD ENTERED THE IMPERIAL NAVY AND HAD ALREADY REACHED THE RANK OF LIEUTENANT WINN ACCOUNT APPOINTED HIM TO THE CHARGE OF HIS OWN PRIVATE YACHT IN WHICH HE WAS ACCUSTOMED TO SPEND BY FAR THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME THROUGHOUT THE WINTER GENERALLY CRUISING IN THE MEDITERRANEAN WHILST IN THE SUMMER HE VISITED MORE NORTHERN WATERS 
lbi-5105-28241-0002 THE LATE ASTOUNDING EVENTS HOWEVER HAD RENDERED PROCOPE MANIFESTLY UNEASY AND NOT THE LESS SO FROM HIS CONSCIOUSNESS THAT THE COUNT'S SECRETLY PARTOOK OF HIS OWN ANXIETY 
lbi-5105-28241-0003 STEAM UP IN CANVAS SPREAD THE SCHOONER STARTED EASTWARDS 
lbi-5105-28241-0004 ALTHOUGH ONLY A MODERATE BREEZE WAS BLOWING THE SEA WAS ROUGH A CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY BY THE DIMINUTION IN THE FORCE OF THE EARTH'S ATTRACTION RENDERING THE LIQUID PARTICLE SO BUOYANT THAT BY THE MERE EFFECT OF OSCILLATION THEY WERE CARRIED TO A HEIGHT THAT WAS QUITE UNPRECEDENTED 
lbi-5105-28241-0005 FOR A FEW MILES SHE FOLLOWED THE LINE HITHERTO PRESUMABLY OCCUPIED BY THE COAST OF ALGERIA BUT NO LAND APPEARED TO THE SOUTH 
lbi-5105-28241-0006 THE LOG AND THE COMPASS THEREFORE WERE ABLE TO BE CALLED UPON TO DO THE WORK OF THE SEXTANT WHICH HAD BECOME UTTERLY USELESS 
lbi-5105-28241-0007 THERE'S NO FEAR OF THAT SIR 
lbi-5105-28241-0008 THAT THE EARTH HAS UNDOUBTEDLY ENTERED UPON A NEW ORBIT BUT SHE IS NOT ENCOURAGING ANY PROBABLE RISK OF BEING PRECIPITATED ON TO THE SUN 
lbi-5105-28241-0009 AND WHAT DEMONSTRATION D'YOU OFFER ASKED SERVANT JACK EAGERLY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN 
lbi-5105-28241-0010 OCEAN REIGNED SUPREME 
lbi-5105-28241-0011 ALL THE IMAGES OF HIS PAST LIFE FLOATED UPON HIS MEMORY HIS THOUGHTS SPED AWAY TO HIS NATIVE FRANCE ONLY TO RETURN AGAIN TO WONDER WHETHER THE DEPTHS OF OCEAN WOULD REVEAL ANY TRACES OF THE ALGERIAN METROPOLIS 
lbi-5105-28241-0012 IS IT NOT IMPOSSIBLE HE MURMURED ALOUD THAT ANY CITY SHOULD DISAPPEAR SO COMPLETELY 
lbi-5105-28241-0013 WOULD NOT THE LOFTIEST EMINENCES OF THE CITY AT LEAST BE VISIBLE 
lbi-5105-28241-0014 ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE 
lbi-5105-28241-0015 TO THE SURPRISE OF ALL AND ESPECIALLY OF LIEUTENANT PROCOPE THE LINE INDICATED A BOTTOM AT A NEARLY UNIFORM DEPTH OF FROM FOUR TO FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH THE SOUNDING WAS PERSEVERED WITH CONTINUOUSLY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS OVER A CONSIDERABLE AREA THE DIFFERENCES OF LEVEL WERE INSIGNIFICANT NOT CORRESPONDING IN ANY DEGREE TO WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED OVER THE SITE OF A CITY THAT HAD BEEN TERRACED LIKE THE SEATS OF AN AMPHITHEATRE 
lbi-5105-28241-0016 YOU MUST SEAT LIEUTENANT I SHOULD THINK THAT WE ARE NOT SO NEAR THE COAST OF ALGERIA AS YOU IMAGINED 
lbi-5105-28241-0017 AFTER PONDERING AWHILE HE SAID IF WE WERE FARTHER AWAY I SHOULD EXPECT TO FIND A DEPTH OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED FATHOMS INSTEAD OF FIVE FATHOMS FIVE FATHOMS 
lbi-5105-28241-0018 ITS DEPTH REMAINED INVARIABLE STILL FOUR OR AT MOST FIVE FATHOMS AND ALTHOUGH ITS BOTTOM WAS ASSIDUOUSLY DREDGED IT WAS ONLY TO PROVE IT BARREN OF MARINE PRODUCTION OF ANY TYPE 
lbi-5105-28241-0019 NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURNED AND DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARD THE NORTH 
lbi-5142-33396-0000 AT ANOTHER TIME HAROLD ASKED 
lbi-5142-33396-0001 WHAT IS YOUR COUNTRY OLAF HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN A THRALL THE THRALLS EYES FLASHED 
lbi-5142-33396-0002 TWO HUNDRED WARRIORS FEASTED HIS HALL AND FOLLOWED HIM TO BATTLE

lbi-5142-33396-0004 THESE HE GAVE TO THREE OF MY BROTHERS 
lbi-5142-33396-0005 BUT I STAYED THAT SPRING AND BUILT ME A BOAT 
lbi-5142-33396-0006 I MADE HER FULLY TWENTY OARS BECAUSE I THOUGHT YOU MEN WOULD FOLLOW ME FOR I WAS YOUNG FIFTEEN YEARS OLD

lbi-5142-33396-0010 IN THE STERN I CARVED THE TALE OF ALMOST AS HIGH AS THE HEAD

lbi-5142-33396-0014 THIRTY MEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER RAISE THEIR HORNS INSTEAD 
lbi-5142-33396-0015 AS OUR BOAT FLASH DOWN THE ROLLERS INTO THE WATER I MADE THE SONG AND SANG IT 
lbi-5142-33396-0016 SO WE HARRIED THE COAST OF NORWAY 
lbi-5142-33396-0017 WE ATE AT MANY MEN'S TABLES UNINVITED 
lbi-5142-33396-0018 A DRAGON'S BELLY IS NEVER FULL AND ON BOARD WENT THE GOLD 
lbi-5142-33396-0019 OH IT IS BETTER TO LIVE ON A SEA AND LET OTHER MEN RAISE YOUR CROPS AND COOK YOUR MEALS 
lbi-5142-33396-0020 A HOUSE SMELLS OF SMOKE A SHIP SMELLS OF FROLIC 
lbi-5142-33396-0021 UP AND DOWN THE WATER WE WENT TO GET MUCH WEALTH IN MUCH FROLIC 
lbi-5142-33396-0022 ONE OF THE FARM OLAF NOT YET I ANSWERED BY KING IS BETTER FOR SUMMER 
lbi-5142-33396-0023 IT WAS SO DARK THAT I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A FEW SPARKS ON THE HEARTH 
lbi-5142-33396-0024 I STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL FOR I WANTED NO SWORD REACHING OUT OF THE DARK FOR ME 
lbi-5142-33396-0025 COME COME ARE CALLED WHEN NO ONE OBEYED AFIRE

lbi-5142-33396-0032 THE FARMER SAT GLOOMILY ON THE BENCH AND NODDY AND YOU CANNOT WONDER FOR HE SAW US PUTTING POCKETFULS OF HIS GOOD BEEF AND BASKET LOADS OF BREAD AND OUR BIG MOUTH 
lbi-5142-33396-0033 YOU WOULD NOT BE WITH US YOU CANNOT SAY NO TO HALF OF MY TALE I DRINK THIS TO YOUR HEALTH 
lbi-5142-33396-0034 THEN I DRANK HALF OF THE MOURNFUL AND SET THE REST ACROSS THE FIRE TO THE FARMER HE TOOK IT AND SMILED SAYING

lbi-5142-33396-0068 SO I LIVED AND NOW IN YOUR TOOTH THRALL WELL IT IS THE LUCK OF WAR 
lbi-5142-36377-0000 IT WAS ONE OF THE MASTERLY AND CHARMING STORIES OF DUMAS THE ELDER 
lbi-5142-36377-0001 IN FIVE MINUTES I WAS IN A NEW WORLD AND MY MELANCHOLY ROOM WAS FULL OF THE LIVELIEST FRENCH COMPANY 
lbi-5142-36377-0002 THE SOUND OF AN IMPERATIVE AN UNCOMPROMISING BELL RECALLED ME IN DUE TIME TO THE REGIONS OF REALITY 
lbi-5142-36377-0003 AMBROSE MET ME AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND SHOWED ME THE WAY TO THE SUPPER ROOM 
lbi-5142-36377-0004 SHE SIGNED TO ME WITH A GHOSTLY SOLEMNITY TO TAKE THE VACANT PLACE ON THE LEFT OF HER FATHER 
lbi-5142-36377-0005 THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN WHILE I WAS STILL STUDYING THE TWO BROTHERS WITHOUT I HONESTLY CONFESS BEING VERY FAVORABLY IMPRESSED BY EITHER OF THEM 
lbi-5142-36377-0006 A NEW MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CIRCLE WHO INSTANTLY ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION ENTERED THE ROOM 
lbi-5142-36377-0007 A LITTLE CRACK THAT IN THE POPULAR PHRASE AS MY IMPRESSION OF THE STRANGER WHO NOW MADE HIS APPEARANCE IN THE SUPPER ROOM 
lbi-5142-36377-0008 MISTER MET ACROSS THE ELDER HAVING NOT SPOKEN ONE WORD THUS FAR HIMSELF INTRODUCED NEWCOMER TO ME WITH A SIDE GLANCE AT HIS SON'S WHICH HAD SOMETHING LIKE DEFIANCE IN IT A GLANCE WHICH AS I WAS SORRY TO NOTICE WAS RETURNED WITH THE DEFIANCE ON THEIR SIDE BY THE TWO YOUNG MEN 
lbi-5142-36377-0009 PHILIP LE FRANC THIS'S MY OVERLOOKER MISTER JAGO SAID THE OLD MAN FORMALLY PRESENTING US 
lbi-5142-36377-0010 HE IS NOT WELL HE HAS COME OVER THE OCEAN FOR REST AND CHANGE OF SCENE 
lbi-5142-36377-0011 THIS GEOGRAPHERS IN AMERICAN PHILIP 
lbi-5142-36377-0012 MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH MISTER JAGO SIP TOGETHER 
lbi-5142-36377-0013 THEY POINTEDLY DREW BACK FROM JOHN JAGO AS HE APPROACHED THE EMPTY CHAIR NEXT ME AND MOVE ROUND TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE TABLE 
lbi-5142-36377-0014 A PRETTY GIRL AS FAR AS I COULD JUDGE BY APPEARANCES A GOOD GIRL TO DESCRIBE IN HER GENERALLY I MAY SAY THAT SHE HAD A SMALL HEAD WELL CARRIED AND WELL SET ON SHOULDERS BRIGHT GRAY EYES THAT LOOKED AT YOU HONESTLY AND MEANT WHAT THEY LOOKED A TRIM SLIGHT LITTLE FIGURE TOO SLIGHT FOR OUR ENGLISH NOTIONS OF BEAUTY A STRONG AMERICAN ACCENT AND A RARE THING IN AMERICA A PLEASANTLY TONED VOICE WHICH MADE THE ACCENT AGREEABLE TO ENGLISH EARS 
lbi-5142-36377-0015 OUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF PEOPLE ARE IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN THE RIGHT IMPRESSIONS 
lbi-5142-36377-0016 FOR ONCE IN A WAY I'VE PROVED A TRUE PROPHET 
lbi-5142-36377-0017 THE ONLY CHEERFUL CONVERSATION WAS THE CONVERSATION ACROSS THE TABLE BETWEEN AMY AND ME 
lbi-5142-36377-0018 HE LOOKED UP NOW ME DOUBTINGLY FROM ITS PLACE AND LOOKED DOWN AGAIN SLOWLY WITH A FROWN 
lbi-5142-36377-0019 WHEN I ADDRESSED HIM HE ANSWERED CONSTRAINEDLY 
lbi-5142-36377-0020 A MORE DREARY AND MORE DISUNITED FAMILY PARTY I NEVER SAT AT A TABLE WITH 
lbi-5142-36377-0021 ENVY HATRED MALICE AND UNCHARITABLENESS ARE NEVER SO ESSENTIALLY DETESTABLE TO MY MIND AS WHEN THEY ARE ANIMATED BY THE SENSE OF PROPRIETY AND WORK UNDER THE SURFACE BUT FOR MY INTEREST AND THEY OWE ME IN MY OTHER INTEREST IN THE LITTLE LOVE LOCKS WHICH I NOW AND THEN SURPRISED PASSING GREENHORN AMBROSE I SHOULD NEVER HAVE SAT THROUGH THAT SUPPER 
lbi-5142-36377-0022 I WISH YOU GOOD NIGHT SHE LAID HER BONY HANDS ON THE BACK OF MISTER MET ACROSS INVALID CHAIR CUT HIM SHORT IN HIS FAREWELL SALUTATION ME AND WHEELED HIM OUT TO HIS BED AS IF SHE WERE WHEELING HIM OUT TO HIS GRAVE 
lbi-5142-36377-0023 YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT TO SAY NO AMBROSE BEGAN NEVER SMOKE WHICH ALIAGA HIS CIGARS WILL POISON YOU 
lbi-5142-36377-0024 THEY ONLY SHOOK A FOREFINGER REPROACHFULLY AT THEM AS IF THE TWO STURDY YOUNG FARMERS HAD BEEN TWO CHILDREN 
lbi-5142-36377-0025 SILAS SLUNK AWAY WITHOUT A WORD OF PROTEST AMBROSE STOOD HIS GROUND EVIDENTLY BENT ON MAKING HIS PEACE WITH ME BEFORE HE LEFT HER SEEING THAT I WAS IN THE WAY I WALKED ASIDE TOWARD A GLASS DOOR AT THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM 
lbi-5142-36586-0000 IT IS MANIFEST THAT MAN IS NOW SUBJECT MUCH VARIABILITY 
lbi-5142-36586-0001 SO IT IS WITH THE LOWER ANIMALS 
lbi-5142-36586-0002 THE VARIABILITY OF MULTIPLE PARTS 
lbi-5142-36586-0003 BUT THIS SUBJECT WILL BE MORE PROPERLY DISCUSSED WHEN WE TREAT OF THE DIFFERENT RACES OF MANKIND 
lbi-5142-36586-0004 EFFECTS OF THE INCREASED USE AND DISUSE OF PARTS 
lbi-5142-36600-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN ON THE RACES OF MAN 
lbi-5142-36600-0001 IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO A MORE ALLIED FORMS ARE TO BE RANKED AS SPECIES OR VARIETIES NATURALISTS ARE PRACTICALLY GUIDED BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS NAMELY THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM AND WHETHER SUCH DIFFERENCES RELATE FEW OR MANY POINTS OF STRUCTURE AND WHETHER THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE BUT MORE ESPECIALLY WHETHER THEY ARE CONSTANT 
lbi-5639-40744-0000 ELEVEN O'CLOCK HAD STRUCK IT WAS A FINE CLEAR NIGHT THERE WERE THE ONLY PERSONS ON THE ROAD AND THEY SAUNTERED LEISURELY ALONG TO AVOID PAYING THE PRICE OF FATIGUE FOR THE RECREATION PROVIDED FOR THE TWO LEGIONS IN THE VALLEY OR ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER 
lbi-5639-40744-0001 SECURE AS HE THOUGHT AND A CAREFUL ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE IN THAT CITY AND THE CHARACTER OF ITS WELL DISPOSED INHABITANTS THE GOOD HIDALGO WAS FAR FROM THINKING THAT ANY DISASTER COULD BEFALL HIS FAMILY 
lbi-5639-40744-0002 RUDOLPH AND HIS COMPANIONS WITH THEIR FACES MUFFLED IN THEIR CLOAKS STARED RUDELY AND INSOLENTLY AT THE MOTHER THE DAUGHTER AND THE SERVANT MAID 
lbi-5639-40744-0003 IN A MOMENT HE COMMUNICATED HIS THOUGHTS TO HIS COMPANIONS AND IN THE NEXT MOMENT THEY RESOLVED TO TURN BACK AND CARRY HER OFF TO PLEASE RIDDELL FOR THE RICH WHO ARE OPEN HANDED ALWAYS FIND PARIS EYES READY TO ENCOURAGE THEIR BAD PROPENSITIES AND THUS TO CONCEIVE THIS WICKED DESIGN TO COMMUNICATED APPROVE IT RESOLVED ON RADISHES LEOCADIA AND TO CARRY THAT DESIGN INTO EFFECT WAS THE WORK OF A MOMENT 
lbi-5639-40744-0004 THEY DREW THEIR SWORDS HID THEIR FACES IN THE FLAPS OF THEIR CLOAKS TURNED BACK AND SOON CAME IN FRONT OF THE LITTLE PARTY WHO HAD NOT YET DONE GIVING THANKS TO GOD FOR THEIR ESCAPE FROM THOSE ODIOUS MEN 
lbi-5639-40744-0005 FINALLY THE ONE PARTY WENT OFF EXULTING AND THE OTHER WAS LEFT IN DESOLATION AND WOE 
lbi-5639-40744-0006 RUDOLF ARRIVED AT HIS OWN HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT ALCAEUS PARENT'S REACH DARES HEARTBROKEN AND DESPAIRING 
lbi-5639-40744-0007 MEANWHILE RUDOLFO HAD LEUCADIA SAFE IN HIS CUSTODY AND IN HIS OWN APARTMENT 
lbi-5639-40744-0008 TOUCHES ME AM I IN BED 
lbi-5639-40744-0009 MOTHER DEAR FATHER DO YOU HEAR ME 
lbi-5639-40744-0010 IT IS THE ONLY AMENDS I ASK OF YOU FOR THE WRONG YOU HAVE DONE ME 
lbi-5639-40744-0011 SHE FOUND THE DOOR BUT IT WAS LOCKED OUTSIDE 
lbi-5639-40744-0012 SHE SUCCEEDED IN OPENING THE WINDOW AND THE MOONLIGHT SHONE SO BRIGHTLY THAT SHE COULD DISTINGUISH THE COLOR OF SOME DAMASK HANGING IN THE ROOM 
lbi-5639-40744-0013 SHE SAW THAT THE BED WAS GILDED AND SO RICH THAT IT SEEMED THAT OF A PRINCE RATHER THAN OF A PRIVATE GENTLEMAN 
lbi-5639-40744-0014 AMONG OTHER THINGS ON WHICH SHE CAST HER EYES WAS A SMALL CRUCIFIX OF SOLID SILVER STANDING ON A CABINET NEAR THE WINDOW 
lbi-5639-40744-0015 THIS PERSON WAS A RIDDLE FOR ALTHOUGH HE HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR HIS FRIENDS HAD CHANGED HIS MIND IN THAT RESPECT NOT THINKING IT ADVISABLE TO ACQUAINT THEM WITH WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE GIRL 
lbi-5639-40744-0016 ON THE CONTRARY HE RESOLVED TO TELL THEM THAT REPENTING OF HIS VIOLENCE AND MOVED BY HER TEARS HE HAD ONLY CARRIED HER HALF WAY TOWARDS HIS HOUSE AND THEN LET HER GO 
lbi-5639-40744-0017 CHOKING WITH EMOTION LEUCADIA MADE A SIGN TO HER PARENTS THAT SHE WISHED TO BE ALONE WITH THEM 
lbi-5639-40744-0018 THAT WILL BE VERY WELL MY CHILD REPLIED FATHER IF YOUR PLAN WERE NOT LIABLE TO BE FRUSTRATED BY ORDINARY CUNNING I'VE NO DOUBT THIS IMAGE HAD BEEN ALREADY MISSED BY ITS OWNER AND HE WILL HAVE SET IT DOWN FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE ROOM BY THE PERSON WHO LOCKED UP THERE 
lbi-5639-40744-0019 WHAT YOU HAD BEST DO MY CHILD IS TO KEEP IT AND PRAY TO IT THAT SINCE IT WAS A WITNESS TO YOUR UNDOING IT WILL DEIGN TO VINDICATE YOUR CAUSE BY ITS RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT 
lbi-5639-40744-0020 THUS TO THE HUMANE AND RIGHT MINDED FAW TO COMFORT HIS UNHAPPY DAUGHTER AND HER MOTHER EMBRACING HER AGAIN DID ALL SHE COULD TO SOOTHE THE FEELINGS 
lbi-5639-40744-0021 SHE MEANWHILE PASSED HER LIFE WITH HER PARENTS IN THE STRICTEST RETIREMENT NEVER LETTING HERSELF BE SEEN BUT SHUNNING EVERY EYE LEST IT SHOULD READ HER MISFORTUNE IN HER FACE 
lbi-5639-40744-0022 TIME ROLLED ON THE HOUR OF HER DELIVERY ARRIVED IT TOOK PLACE IN THE UTMOST SECRECY HER MOTHER TAKING UPON HER THE OFFICE OF MIDWIVES AS SHE GAVE BIRTH TO A SON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EVER SEEN 
lbi-5639-40744-0023 AND THE BOY WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS BLESSINGS WERE SHOWERED UPON HIM BY ALL WHO SAW HIM BLESSING UPON HIS BEAUTY UPON THE MOTHER THAT BORE HIM UP ON THE FATHER THAT BEGOT HIM UPON THOSE WHO BROUGHT HIM UP SO WELL 
lbi-5639-40744-0024 ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS SENT BY HIS GRANDFATHER WITH A MESSAGE TO OUR RELATION HE PASSED ALONG A STREET IN WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT CONCOURSE OF HORSEMEN 
lbi-5639-40744-0025 THE BED SHE TOO WELL REMEMBERED WAS THERE AND ABOUT ALL THE CABINET ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAGE SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS STILL ON THE SAME SPOT 
lbi-5639-40744-0026 LOUIS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORTNIGHT AND A MONTH HE ROSE FROM HIS BED AND DURING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISITED DAILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER AND TREATED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THEIR OWN CHILD 
lbi-5639-40744-0027 THUS SAYING AND PRESSING THE CRUCIFIX TO HER BREAST SHE FELL FAINTING INTO THE ARMS OF DONNA ESTEFANIA WHO WAS A GENTLEWOMAN TO WHOSE SEX PITY AS UNNATURAL AS CRUELTY IS TO MAN INSTANTLY PRESSED HER LIPS TO THOSE OF THE FAINTING GIRL SHEDDING OVER HER SO MANY TEARS THAT THERE NEEDED NO OTHER SPRINKLING OF WATER TO RECOVER LEUCADIA FROM HER SWOON 
lbi-5639-40744-0028 I HAVE GREAT THINGS TO TELL YOU SENOR SAID DORIS TO FINANCE TO HER HUSBAND THE CREAM AND SUBSTANCE OF WHICH IS THUS THE FAINTING GIRL BEFORE YOU IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND THE BOY IS YOUR GRANDSON 
lbi-5639-40744-0029 THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAVE LEARNED FROM HER LIPS IS CONFIRMED BY HIS FACE AND WISH WE HAD BOTH BEHELD THAT OF OUR SUN 
lbi-5639-40744-0030 JUSTIN LEUCADIA CAME TO HERSELF AND EMBRACING THE CROSS SEEMED CHANGED INTO A SEA OF TEARS AND THE GENTLEMEN REMAINING IN UTTER BEWILDERMENT UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPEATED TO HIM FROM BEGINNING TO END THERE ARCADIUS WHOLE STORY AND HE BELIEVED IT THROUGH THE BLESS'D DISPENSATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONFIRMED IT BY SO MANY CONVINCING TESTIMONIES 
lbi-5639-40744-0031 SO PERSUASIVE WERE HER ENTREATIES AND SO STRONG ASSURANCES THAT NO HARM WHATEVER COULD RESULT TO THEM FROM THE INFORMATION SHE SOUGHT THEY WERE INDUCED TO CONFESS THAT ONE SUMMER'S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MENTIONED AND SOLVES AND ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON A STROLL WITH HER DOLEFUL THEY HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN THE ADOPTION OF A GIRL WHOM RADOLFSZELL CARRIED OFF WHILST THE REST OF THEM DETAINED HER FAMILY WHO MADE A GREAT OUTCRY AND WOULD HAVE DEFENDED HER IF THEY COULD 
lbi-5639-40744-0032 FOR GOD'S SAKE MY LADY MOTHER GIVE ME A WIFE WHO WOULD BE AN AGREEABLE COMPANION NOT ONE WHO WILL DISGUST ME SO THAT WE MAY BOTH BEAR EVENLY AND WITH MUTUAL GOOD WILL A YOKE IMPOSED ON US BY HEAVEN INSTEAD OF PULLING THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AND FRETTING EACH OTHER TO DEATH 
lbi-5639-40744-0033 HER BEARING WAS GRACEFUL AND ANIMATED SHE LED HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MAIDS WITH WAX LIGHTS IN SILVER CANDLESTICKS 
lbi-5639-40744-0034 ALL ROSE TO DO HER REVERENCE AS IF SOMETHING FROM HEAVEN HAD MIRACULOUSLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM BUT GAZING ON HER ENTRANCED WITH ADMIRATION NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO ADDRESS A SINGLE WORD TO HER 
lbi-5639-40744-0035 SHE REFLECTED HOW NEAR SHE STOOD TO THE CRISIS WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BLESSED OR UNHAPPY FOREVER AND RACKED BY THE INTENSITY OF HER EMOTIONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGED COLOUR HER HEAD DROPPED AND SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SWOON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DISMAYED ESTEFANIA 
lbi-5639-40744-0036 HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DESTINED PROTECTOR BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS INSENSIBLE SHE WAS NEAR MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD YOU NOT COME TO HIMSELF 
lbi-5639-40744-0037 KNOW THEN SON OF MY HEART THAT THIS FAINTING LADY IS YOUR REAL BRIDE I SAY REAL BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE WHOM YOU FATHER AND I HAVE CHOSEN FOR YOU AND A PORTRAIT WAS A PRETENSE 
lbi-5639-40744-0038 JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE TEARS OF THE PITYING BEHOLDERS FLOWED FASTEST AND THEIR EJACULATIONS WHEN MOST EXPRESSIVE OF DESPAIR LEOCADIA GIVES SIGNS OF RECOVERY AND BROUGHT BACK GLADNESS TO THE HEARTS OF ALL 
lbi-5639-40744-0039 WHEN SHE CAME TO HER SENSES AND BLUSHING TO FIND HERSELF IN RODOLPHE'S ARMS WOULD HAVE DISENGAGED HERSELF NO SIGNORA HE SAID THAT MUST NOT BE STRIVE NOT TO WITHDRAW FROM THE ARMS OF HIM WHO HOLDS YOU IN HIS SOUL 
lbi-5639-40744-0040 THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVENT TOOK PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES WAS SUFFICIENT FOR THE CELEBRATION OF A MARRIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRELIMINARY FORMALITIES WHICH ARE NOW SO PROPERLY REQUIRED 
lbi-5639-40744-0041 NOR WAS HER DOCILE LESS SURPRISE THAN THEY AND THE BETTER TO ASSURE HIMSELF OF SO WONDERFUL A FACT HE BEGGED LEUCADIA TOO GIVE HIM SOME TOKEN WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECTLY CLEAR TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTHENTICATED BY HIS PARENTS 
lbi-5683-32865-0000 YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LEEK 
lbi-5683-32865-0001 SAID LORD CHELSFORD ADDRESSING ME 
lbi-5683-32865-0002 HE HAD HIS HAND UPON THE SHOULDER 
lbi-5683-32865-0003 THEY ARE COUSINS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL COUSINS 
lbi-5683-32865-0004 WHATEVER LORD CHELSFORD SAID MISS BRANDON RECEIVED IT VERY GRACIOUSLY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENTARY SMILE 
lbi-5683-32865-0005 BUT HER GREETING TO CAPTAIN LEEK WAS MORE THAN USUALLY HAUGHTY AND FROZEN AND HER FEATURES I FANCIED PARTICULARLY PROUD AND PALE 
lbi-5683-32865-0006 AT DINNER LAKE WAS EASY AND AMUSING 
lbi-5683-32865-0007 I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS WILDERED CHUCKLING BENIGNANTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULDER 
lbi-5683-32865-0008 I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE TASTE THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JEWELS 
lbi-5683-32865-0009 AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN'S FINGERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LAMP AND CONTEMPLATED THE LITTLE PARALLELOGRAM WITH A GLEAM OF SLY AMUSEMENT 
lbi-5683-32865-0010 I WAS THINKING IT'S VERY LIKE THE ACE OF HEARTS ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFTLY SMILING ON 
lbi-5683-32865-0011 WHEREUPON LAKE LAUGHED QUIETLY STILL LOOKING ON THE ACE OF HEARTS WITH HIS SLY EYES 
lbi-5683-32865-0012 AND WILDER LAUGH TO MORE SUDDENLY AND NOISILY THAN THE HUMOUR OF THE JOKE SEEMS QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GLANCED A GRIM LOOK FROM THE CORNERS OF HIS EYES UNLIKE BUT THE GALLANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PERCEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECONDS MORE HE HANDED IT VERY INNOCENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DOROTHY ONLY REMARKING 
lbi-5683-32865-0013 DO YOU KNOW LAKE OH I REALLY CAN'T TELL BUT HE'LL SOON TIRE OF COUNTRY LIFE 
lbi-5683-32865-0014 HE'S NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUARTERS 
lbi-5683-32865-0015 I HAD A HORRID DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THAT 
lbi-5683-32865-0016 OH I KNOW THAT LORNE BRANDON 
lbi-5683-32865-0017 ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALKING TO ME HIS ANGRY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOWING LEAGUE 
lbi-5683-32866-0000 MISS LAKE DECLINED THE CARRIAGE TO NIGHT 
lbi-5683-32866-0001 AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMPLIMENTARY 
lbi-5683-32866-0002 BUT THESE VERY WISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOLISHLY 
lbi-5683-32866-0003 IN THE MEANTIME I HAD FORMED A NEW IDEA OF HER 
lbi-5683-32866-0004 BY THIS TIME LORD CHELSFORD AMALDI RETURNED AND DISGUSTED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RUMINATED ON MY WANT OF GENERALSHIP 
lbi-5683-32866-0005 AND HE MADE A LITTLE DIP OF HIS CANE TOWARDS BRANDON HALL OVER HIS SHOULDER 
lbi-5683-32866-0006 YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WORSE 
lbi-5683-32866-0007 IF A FELLOW'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD HE'S BEELZEBUB AT ONCE 
lbi-5683-32866-0008 BRACKTON'S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASSURE YOU 
lbi-5683-32866-0009 I DON'T KNOW I CAN'T SAY HOW YOU FINE GENTLEMEN TO FIND WICKEDNESS ONLY AS AN OBSCURE FEMALE I SPEAK ACCORDING TO MY LIGHTS AND HE IS GENERALLY THOUGHT THE WICKEDEST MAN IN THIS COUNTY 
lbi-5683-32866-0010 WELL YOU KNOW REEDY WOMEN LIKE WICKED FELLOWS IT IS CONTRAST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND I'M SURE FROM WHAT BROCKTON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INTIMATELY THAT DORCAS LIKES HIM AND I CAN'T CONCEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MARRIED 
lbi-5683-32866-0011 THEIR WALK CONTINUED SILENT FOR THE GREATER PART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH THE OTHER BUT RACHEL AT LAST SAID 
lbi-5683-32866-0012 NOW THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE REMEDY FOR I REALLY DON'T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALKING 
lbi-5683-32866-0013 THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOONLIGHT BROKEN BY THE SHADOWS OF OVERHANGING BOUGHS AND WITHERED LEAVES AND THE MOTTLED LIGHTS AND SHADOWS GLIDED ODDLY ACROSS HIS PALE FEATURES 
lbi-5683-32866-0014 DON'T INSULT ME STANLEY BY TALKING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING 
lbi-5683-32866-0015 WHAT I SAY IS ALTOGETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT 
lbi-5683-32866-0016 MARK MY WORDS YOU'LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU AY AND TOO DEEP 
lbi-5683-32866-0017 I AM VERY UNEASY ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN'T HELP IT 
lbi-5683-32866-0018 TO MY MIND THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING INEXPRESSIBLY AWFUL IN FAMILY FEUDS 
lbi-5683-32866-0019 THE MYSTERY OF THEIR ORIGIN THEIR CAPACITY FOR EVOLVING LATENT FACULTIES OF CRIME AND THE STUDY VITALITY WITH WHICH THEY SURVIVED THE HEARSE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTH MALIGNITIES AND EVERY NEW BORN GENERATION HAVE ASSOCIATED THEM SOMEHOW IN MY MIND WITH A SPELL OF LIFE EXCEEDING AND DISTINCT FROM HUMAN AND ESPECIAL SATANIC ACTION 
lbi-5683-32866-0020 THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOWED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM 
lbi-5683-32866-0021 MY BED WAS UNEXCEPTIONABLY COMFORTABLE BUT IN MY THEN MOOD I COULD HAVE WISHED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MODERN 
lbi-5683-32866-0022 ITS CURTAINS WERE THICK AND FADED TAPESTRY 
lbi-5683-32866-0023 ALL THE FURNITURE BELONGED TO OTHER TIMES 
lbi-5683-32866-0024 I SHAN'T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRAIN OF THOUGHTS OR FANCIES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN AND A GHOST STORY WATCHING EXPERIMENTALLY IN A HAUNTED CHAMBER 
lbi-5683-32866-0025 I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRECAUTION OF SMOKING UP THE CHIMNEY 
lbi-5683-32866-0026 I BOLDLY LIGHTED MY ROUTE 
lbi-5683-32866-0027 A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SHINING WITH CLEAR SHARP LIGHTS AND SHADOWS 
lbi-5683-32866-0028 THE SOMBRE OLD TREES LIKE GIGANTIC HEARSE PLUMES BLACK AND AWFUL 
lbi-5683-32866-0029 SOMEHOW I HAD GROWN NERVOUS 
lbi-5683-32866-0030 A LITTLE BIT OF PLASTER TUMBLE DOWN THE CHIMNEY AND STARTLED ME CONFOUNDEDLY 
lbi-5683-32879-0000 IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELEVEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PONY CARRIAGE FROM BRANDON DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN WICKET OF REDMOND'S FARM 
lbi-5683-32879-0001 WHILE SHE WAS BETTER THOUGH SHE HAD HAD A BAD NIGHT 
lbi-5683-32879-0002 SO THERE CAME A STEP AND A LITTLE RUSTLING OF FEMININE DRAPERIES THE SMALL DOOR OPENED AND RACHEL ENTERED WITH HER HAND EXTENDED AND A PALE SMILE OF WELCOME 
lbi-5683-32879-0003 WOMEN CAN HIDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN SHANE DROPS FIRE INTO THE DREADFUL CHALICE 
lbi-5683-32879-0004 BUT POOR RACHEL LEEK HAD MORE THAN THAT STOICAL HYPOCRISY WHICH ENABLES THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF HER SEX TO LIFT A PALE FACE THROUGH THE FLAMES AND SMILE 
lbi-5683-32879-0005 THIS TRANSIT SPRING AND LIGHTING UP OUR BEAUTIFUL A GLAMOUR BEGUILING OUR SENSES 
lbi-5683-32879-0006 THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEETNESS AND FONDNESS IN HER TONES AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEW TO RACHEL AND COMFORTING AND SHE RETURNED THE GREETING AS KINDLY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORMER SELF 
lbi-5683-32879-0007 RACHEL'S PALE AND SHARPENED FEATURES AND DILATED EYE STRUCK HER WITH A PAINFUL SURPRISE 
lbi-5683-32879-0008 YOU HAVE BEEN SO ILL MY POOR RACHEL

lbi-5683-32879-0011 SHE SPOKE WITH A SUDDEN ENERGY WHICH PARTOOK OF FEAR AND PASSION AND FLUSHED HER THIN CHEEK AND MADE HER LANGUID EYES FLASH

lbi-61-70970-0024 THEY MOVED THEREAFTER CAUTIOUSLY ABOUT THE HUT GROPING BEFORE AND ABOUT THEM TO FIND SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT WARRINGTON HAD FULFILLED HIS MISSION 
lbi-61-70970-0025 THEY WERE UPON THE VERGE OF AN OPEN TRAP IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE HUT AND STUKELY HAD TRIPPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE REVERSED FLAT MOUTH OF THIS PIT 
lbi-61-70970-0026 FIT YOUTHS AND RESTED AT LAST UPON THE TOP RUNG OF A LADDER AND SLOWLY THE TRUTH CAME TO HIM

lbi-61-70970-0028 INSTANTLY WAS BY HIS SIDE IN A FLASH AND THEN THEY BOTH BEGAN FEELING ABOUT THEM TO ASCERTAIN THE SHAPE AND CHARACTER OF THIS VAULT 
lbi-61-70970-0029 FROM THE BLACKNESS BEHIND THE LIGHT THEY HEARD A VOICE WARRINGTONS

lbi-672-122797-0003 BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR 
lbi-672-122797-0004 IN WINTER WHEN THE SNOW LAY GLITTERING ON THE GROUND A HARE WOULD OFTEN COME LEAPING ALONG AND JUMP RIGHT OVER THE LITTLE TREE 
lbi-672-122797-0005 OH THAT MADE HIM SO ANGRY 
lbi-672-122797-0006 TO GROW AND GROW TO GET OLDER AND VITTORIO THOUGHT THE TREE THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL THING IN THE WORLD 
lbi-672-122797-0007 IN AUTUMN THE WOODCUTTERS ALWAYS CAME AND FELLED SOME OF THE LARGEST TREES

lbi-672-122797-0020 BUT THE TREE DID NOT REJOICE AT ALL HE GREW AND GREW AND WAS GREEN BOTH WINTER AND SUMMER 
lbi-672-122797-0021 AND TOWARDS CHRISTMAS HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS CUT DOWN 
lbi-672-122797-0022 THE AXE STRUCK DEEP INTO THE VERY PITH THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A SIGH HE FELT A PANG AS LIKE A SWOON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPPINESS FOR HE WAS SORROWFUL AT BEING SEPARATED FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPRUNG UP 
lbi-672-122797-0023 HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COMRADES THE LITTLE BUSHES AND FLOWERS AROUND HIM ANY MORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRDS 
lbi-672-122797-0024 THE DEPARTURE WAS NOT AT ALL AGREEABLE 
lbi-672-122797-0025 THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UNLOADED IN A COURTYARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SPLENDID WE DON'T WANT THE OTHERS 
lbi-672-122797-0026 THERE TOO WERE LARGE EASY CHAIRS SILKEN SOFAS LARGE TABLES FULL OF PICTURE BOOKS AND FULL OF TOYS WORTH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CROWNS AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO 
lbi-672-122797-0027 THE SERVANTS AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LADY'S DECORATED IT 
lbi-672-122797-0028 THIS EVENING THEY ALL SAID 
lbi-672-122797-0029 HOW IT WILL SHINE THIS EVENING 
lbi-672-122797-0030 PERHAPS THE OTHER TREES FROM THE FOREST WILL COME TO LOOK AT ME 
lbi-672-122797-0031 IT BLAZED UP FAMOUSLY HELP HELP 
lbi-672-122797-0032 CRIED THE YOUNG LADIES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE 
lbi-672-122797-0033 A STORY 
lbi-672-122797-0034 A STORY CRIED THE CHILDREN DRAWING A LITTLE FAT MAN TOWARDS THE TREE 
lbi-672-122797-0035 BUT I SHALL TELL ONLY ONE STORY 
lbi-672-122797-0036 HUMPTY DUMPTY FELL DOWNSTAIRS AND YET HE MARRIED THE PRINCESS 
lbi-672-122797-0037 THAT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD 
lbi-672-122797-0038 THOUGHT THE FIR TREE AND BELIEVED IT ALL BECAUSE THE MAN WHO TOLD THE STORY WAS SO GOOD LOOKING WELL WELL 
lbi-672-122797-0039 I WON'T TREMBLE TO MORROW THOUGHT THE FIR TREE 
lbi-672-122797-0040 AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT 
lbi-672-122797-0041 IN THE MORNING THE SERVANTS AND THE HOUSEMAID CAME IN 
lbi-672-122797-0042 BUT THEY DRAGGED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE STAIRS INTO THE LOFT AND HERE IN A DARK CORNER WHERE NO DAYLIGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM 
lbi-672-122797-0043 WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS THOUGHT THE TREE 
lbi-672-122797-0044 AND HE LEANED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REVERIE 
lbi-672-122797-0045 TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REFLECTIONS FOR DAYS AND NIGHTS PASSED ON AND NOBODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOMEBODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TRUNKS IN A CORNER OUT OF THE WAY 
lbi-672-122797-0046 TIS NOW WINTER OUT OF DOORS THOUGHT THE TREE 
lbi-672-122797-0047 HOW KIND MAN IS AFTER ALL 
lbi-672-122797-0048 IF IT ONLY WERE NOT SO DARK HERE AND SO TERRIBLY LONELY 
lbi-672-122797-0049 SQUEAK SQUEAK 
lbi-672-122797-0050 THEY SNUFFED ABOUT THE FIR TREE AND RUSTLED AMONG THE BRANCHES 
lbi-672-122797-0051 I AM BY NO MEANS OLD SAID THE FIR TREE 
lbi-672-122797-0052 THERE'S MANY A ONE CONSIDERABLY OLDER THAN I AM 
lbi-672-122797-0053 THEY WERE SO EXTREMELY CURIOUS 
lbi-672-122797-0054 I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE TREE 
lbi-672-122797-0055 AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE MICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LISTENED AND SAID 
lbi-672-122797-0056 SAID THE FIR TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF RELATED 
lbi-672-122797-0057 YES IN REALITY THOSE WERE HAPPY TIMES 
lbi-672-122797-0058 HOO HE'S HUMPY DUMPY ASKED THE MICE 
lbi-672-122797-0059 ONLY THAT ONE ANSWERED THE TREE 
lbi-672-122797-0060 IT IS A VERY STUPID STORY 
lbi-672-122797-0061 DON'T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT BACON AND TALLOW CANDLES CAN TELL ANY LADDER STORIES 
lbi-672-122797-0062 NO SAID THE TREE 
lbi-672-122797-0063 THEN GOOD BYE SAID THE RATS AND THEY WENT HOME 
lbi-672-122797-0064 AT LAST THE LITTLE MICE STAYED AWAY ALSO AND THE TREE SIGHED AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEASANT WHEN THE SLEEK LITTLE MICE SAT ROUND ME AND LISTEN TO WHAT I TOLD THEM 
lbi-672-122797-0065 NOW THAT TOO IS OVER 
lbi-672-122797-0066 WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QUANTITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LOFT 
lbi-672-122797-0067 THE TRUNKS WERE MOVED THE TREE WAS PULLED OUT AND THROWN RATHER HARD AT HIS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE STAIRS WHERE THE DAYLIGHT SHONE 
lbi-672-122797-0068 BUT IT WAS NOT THE FIR TREE THAT THEY MEANT 
lbi-672-122797-0069 IT WAS IN A CORNER THAT HE LAY AMONG WEEDS AND NETTLES 
lbi-672-122797-0070 THE GOLDEN STAR OF TINSEL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GLITTERED IN THE SUNSHINE 
lbi-672-122797-0071 IN THE COURTYARD SOME OF THE MERRY CHILDREN WERE PLAYING WHO HAD DANCED AT CHRISTMAS ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM 
lbi-672-122797-0072 AND THE GARDENER'S BOY CHOPPED THE TREE INTO SMALL PIECES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEAP LYING THERE 
lbi-672-122797-0073 THE WOOD FLAMED UP SPLENDIDLY UNDER THE LARGE BREWING COPPER AND ITS SIDES SO DEEPLY 
lbi-672-122797-0074 HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE THE STORY HAD AN END 
lbi-6829-68769-0000 KENNETH AND BETH REFRAINED FROM TELLING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL ROGERS VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WATSON IN THE LIBRARY AND QUESTIONED HIM CLOSELY ABOUT THE PENALTY FOR FORGING A CHECK 
lbi-6829-68769-0001 IT WAS A SERIOUS CRIME INDEED MISTER WATSON TOLD THEM AND TOM GATES BADE FAIR TO SERVE A LENGTHY TERM IN THE STATE'S PRISON AS A CONSEQUENCE OF HIS RASH ACT 
lbi-6829-68769-0002 I CAN'T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAWYER 
lbi-6829-68769-0003 IT WAS A DELIBERATE THEFT FROM HIS EMPLOYERS TO PROTECT THE GIRL HE LOVED 
lbi-6829-68769-0004 BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROVEN A CASE AGAINST LUCY IF SHE WAS INNOCENT AND ALL THEIR THREATS OF ARRESTING HER WERE PROBABLY A MERE BLUFF 
lbi-6829-68769-0005 HE WAS SOFT HEARTED AND IMPETUOUS SAID BETH AND BEING IN LOVE HE DOESN'T STOP TO COUNT THE COST 
lbi-6829-68769-0006 IF THE PROSECUTION WERE WITHDRAWN AND THE CASE SETTLED WITH THE VICTIM OF THE FORGED CHEQUE THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALLOWED HIS FREEDOM 
lbi-6829-68769-0007 BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT COULD BE MADE 
lbi-6829-68769-0008 FAIRVIEW WAS TWELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O'CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNTY JAIL 
lbi-6829-68769-0009 THEY WERE RECEIVED IN THE LITTLE OFFICE BY A MAN NAMED MARKHAM WHO WAS THE JAILER 
lbi-6829-68769-0010 WE WISH TO TALK WITH HIM ANSWERED KENNETH TALK 
lbi-6829-68769-0011 I'M READING FOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET SAID KENNETH QUIETLY 
lbi-6829-68769-0012 I'LL SAY THAT'S DIFFERENT OBSERVED MARKHAM ALTERING AS DEMETER 
lbi-6829-68769-0013 MAYBE SEE GATES AT ONCE ASK KENNETH 
lbi-6829-68769-0014 THEY FOLLOWED THE JAILER ALONG A SUCCESSION OF PASSAGES 
lbi-6829-68769-0015 SOMETIMES ON THAT YEARNING FOR A SMOKE I'M NEARLY CRAZY AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE DINE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 
lbi-6829-68769-0016 HE UNLOCKED THE DOOR AND CALLED HERE'S VISITORS TOM 
lbi-6829-68769-0017 WORST TO ORSON ERROR REPLIED THE JAILER GLOOMILY 
lbi-6829-68769-0018 MISS DE GRAF SAID KENNETH NOTICING THE BOY'S FACE CRITICALLY AS HE STOOD WHERE THE LIGHT FROM THE PASSAGE FELL UPON IT 
lbi-6829-68769-0019 SORRY WE HAVEN'T ANY RECEPTION ROOM IN THE JAIL 
lbi-6829-68769-0020 SIT DOWN PLEASE SAID GATES IN A CHEERFUL AND PLEASANT VOICE THERE'S A PENSIONER 
lbi-6829-68769-0021 A FRESH WHOLESOME LOOKING BOY WAS TOM GATES WITH STEADY GRAY EYES AND INTELLIGENT FOREHEAD BUT A SENSITIVE RATHER WEAK MOUTH 
lbi-6829-68769-0022 WE HAVE HEARD SOMETHING OF YOUR STORY SAID KENNETH AND ARE INTERESTED IN IT 
lbi-6829-68769-0023 I DIDN'T STOP TO THINK WHETHER IT WAS FOOLISH OR NOT I DID IT AND I'M GLAD I DID IT 
lbi-6829-68769-0024 OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELPLESS SINCE MISSUS ROGERS HAD OR ACCIDENT 
lbi-6829-68769-0025 THEN ROGER'S WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT LEADER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RACK AND RUIN 
lbi-6829-68769-0026 HE SPOKE SIMPLY BUT PACED UP AND DOWN THE NARROW CELL IN FRONT OF THEM 
lbi-6829-68769-0027 WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGNED THE CHEQUE AS KENNETH 
lbi-6829-68769-0028 HE IS SUPPOSED TO SIGN ALL THE CHECKS OF THE CONCERT 
lbi-6829-68769-0029 IT'S A STOCK COMPANY IN RICH 
lbi-6829-68769-0030 I WAS BIT KEEPER SO IT WAS EASY TO GET A BLANK CHECK AND FORGE THE SIGNATURE 
lbi-6829-68769-0031 AS REGARDS MY ROBBING THE COMPANY I'LL SAY THAT I SAVED HIM A HEAVY LOSS ONE DAY 
lbi-6829-68769-0032 I DISCOVERED HIM PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED THE WHOLE PLANT BUT MARSHALL NEVER EVEN THANKED ME 
lbi-6829-68769-0033 IT WAS BETTER FOR HIM TO THINK THE GIRL AND FAILING THAT TO KNOW THE TRUTH 
lbi-6829-68769-0034 I'M GOING TO SEE MISTER MARSHALL SAID KENNETH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASSIST YOU THANK YOU SIR 
lbi-6829-68769-0035 IT WON'T BE MUCH BUT I'M GRATEFUL TO FIND A FRIEND 
lbi-6829-68769-0036 THEY LEFT HIM THEN FOR THE JAILER ARRIVED TO UNLOCK THE DOOR AND ESCORT THEM TO THE OFFICE 
lbi-6829-68769-0037 I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THAT KIND IN MY DAY 
lbi-6829-68769-0038 AND IT RUINS A MAN'S DISPOSITION 
lbi-6829-68769-0039 HE LOOKED UP RATHER UNGRACIOUSLY BUT MOTIONED THEM TO BE SEATED 
lbi-6829-68769-0040 SOME GIRL HAS BEEN IN HERE TWICE TO INTERVIEW MY MEN AND I HAVE REFUSED TO ADMIT HER 
lbi-6829-68769-0041 ANA ELECTIONEERING JUST NOW 
lbi-6829-68769-0042 OH WELL SIR WHAT ABOUT HIM 
lbi-6829-68769-0043 AND HE DESERVES A TERM IN STATE'S PRISON 
lbi-6829-68769-0044 IT HAS COST ME TWICE SIXTY DOLLARS IN ANNOYANCE 
lbi-6829-68769-0045 I'LL PAY ALL THE COST BESIDES 
lbi-6829-68769-0046 YOU'RE FOOLISH WHY SHOULD YOU DO ALL THIS 
lbi-6829-68769-0047 I HAVE MY OWN REASONS MISTER MARSHALL 
lbi-6829-68769-0048 GIMME A CHECK FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY AND I'LL TURN OVER TO YOU THE FORGED CHECK AND QUASH FURTHER PROCEEDINGS 
lbi-6829-68769-0049 HE DETESTED THE GRASPING DISPOSITION THAT WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIS EVIDENT DESIRE TO HELP YOUNG GATES 
lbi-6829-68769-0050 BETH UNEASY AT HIS SILENCE NUDGED HIM 
lbi-6829-68769-0051 THERE WAS A GRIM SMILE OF AMUSEMENT ON HIS SHREWD FACE 
lbi-6829-68769-0052 HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORGED CHECK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE'D BEEN SHARP 
lbi-6829-68769-0053 AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MISERY AND DESPAIR BY THE PAYMENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS

lbi-121-123859-0004 SO I RETURNED REBUKED TO MY CONTENT AND GAIN BY ILL THRICE MORE THAN I HAVE SPENT 
lbi-121-127105-0000 IT WAS THIS OBSERVATION THAT TRUE FROM DOUGLAS NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING A REPLY THAT HAD THE INTERESTING CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION 
lbi-121-127105-0001 SOMEONE ELSE TOLD US DURING A PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE WHICH I SAW HE WAS NOT FOLLOWING 
lbi-121-127105-0002 CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF HER HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF INSTEAD OF ME HE SAW WHAT HE SPOKE OF 
lbi-121-127105-0003 THERE WAS A UNANIMOUS GROANED AT THIS AND MUCH REPROACH AFTER RICH IN HIS PREOCCUPIED WAY HE EXPLAINED 
lbi-121-127105-0004 THE STORIES WRITTEN 
lbi-121-127105-0005 I COULD WRITE TO MY MAN AND ENCLOSED THE KEY HE COULD SEND DOWN THE PACKET AS HE FINDS IT 
lbi-121-127105-0006 THE OTHERS RESENTED POSTPONEMENT BUT IT WAS JUST HIS SCRUPLES THE CHARMED ME 
lbi-121-127105-0007 TO THIS HIS ANSWER WAS PROMPT OH THANK GOD NO END IS THE RECORD YOURS 
lbi-121-127105-0008 HE HUNG FIRE AGAIN A WOMAN'S 
lbi-121-127105-0009 SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THESE TWENTY YEARS 
lbi-121-127105-0010 SHE SENT ME THE PAGES IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED 
lbi-121-127105-0011 SHE WAS THE MOST AGREEABLE WOMAN I'VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTHY OF ANY WHATEVER 
lbi-121-127105-0012 SAID SIMPLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HADN'T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE 
lbi-121-127105-0013 YOU'LL EASILY JUDGE WHY WHEN YOU ARE HERE BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCARE HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME 
lbi-121-127105-0014 YOU ARE A CUTE 
lbi-121-127105-0015 HE QUITTED THE FIRE AND DROPPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR 
lbi-121-127105-0016 PROBABLY NOT TILL THE SECOND POST 
lbi-121-127105-0017 IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERYBODY WILL STAY 
lbi-121-127105-0018 CRIED THE LADIES WHOSE DEPARTURE HAD BEEN FIXED 
lbi-121-127105-0019 MISSUS GRIFFEN HOWEVER EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT 
lbi-121-127105-0020 WHO WAS IT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THIS STORY WILL TELL I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO REPLY OH I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE STORY THE STORY WON'T TELL SAID DOUGLAS NOT IN ANY LITERAL VULGAR WAY MORE'S THE PITY THEN 
lbi-121-127105-0021 WON'T YOU TELL DOUGLAS 
lbi-121-127105-0022 WELL IF I DON'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHO HE WAS 
lbi-121-127105-0023 LET ME SAY HERE DISTINCTLY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS NARRATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANSCRIPT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER AS WHAT I SHALL PRESENTLY GIVE 
lbi-121-127105-0024 POOR DOUGLAS BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WASN'T SIGHT COMMITTED TO ME THE MANUSCRIPT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SPOT WITH IMMENSE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TOO ARE HUSHED LITTLE CIRCLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOURTH 
lbi-121-127105-0025 THE DEPARTING LADIES WHO HAD SAID THEY WOULD STAY DIDN'T OF COURSE THANK HEAVEN STAY THEY DEPARTED IN CONSEQUENCE OF ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN A RAGE OF CURIOSITY AS THEY PROFESSED PRODUCED BY THE TOUCHES WITH WHICH HE HAD ALREADY WORKED UP 
lbi-121-127105-0026 THE FIRST OF THESE TOUCHES CONVEYED THAT THE WRITTEN STATEMENT TOOK UP THE TALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEGUN 
lbi-121-127105-0027 HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RESIDENCE OF BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SPOILS OF TRAVEL AND THE TROPHIES OF THE CHASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ESSEX THAT HE WISHED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PROCEED 
lbi-121-127105-0028 THE AWKWARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACTICALLY NO OTHER RELATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFFAIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME 
lbi-121-127105-0029 THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERNESS WOULD BE IN SUPREME AUTHORITY 
lbi-121-127105-0030 I DON'T ANTICIPATE 
lbi-121-127105-0031 SHE WAS YOUNG UNTRIED NERVOUS IT WAS A VISION OF SERIOUS DUTIES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LONELINESS 
lbi-121-127105-0032 YES BUT THAT'S JUST THE BEAUTY OF HER PASSION 
lbi-121-127105-0033 IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT 
lbi-121-127105-0034 IT SOUNDED DULL THAT SOUNDED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MAIMED CONDITION WHICH WAS 
lbi-121-127105-0035 SHE PROMISED TO DO THIS AND SHE MENTIONED TO ME THAT WHEN FOR A MOMENT DISBURDENED DELIGHTED HE HELD HER HAND THANKING HER FOR THE SACRIFICE SHE ALREADY FELT REWARDED 
lbi-121-127105-0036 BUT WAS THAT ALL HIS REWARD ONE OF THE LADIES ASKED 
lbi-6829-68771-0000 SO TO THE SURPRISE OF THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOPKINS ANNOUNCED THAT HE WOULD OPPOSE FORCE AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN WITH AN EQUAL AGGRESSIVENESS AND SPEND AS MANY DOLLARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY 
lbi-6829-68771-0001 ONE OF MISTER HOPKINS FIRST TASKS AFTER CALLING HIS FAITHFUL HENCHMAN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CAREFUL CANVASS OF THE VOTERS OF HIS DISTRICT TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOMPLISHED 
lbi-6829-68771-0002 THE WEAK KNEED CONTINGENCY MUST BE STRENGTHENED AND FORTIFIED AND A COUPLE OF HUNDRED VOTES IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SECURED FROM THE OPPOSITION 
lbi-6829-68771-0003 THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE FIGURED OUT A WAY TO DO THIS 
lbi-6829-68771-0004 UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS REYNOLDS WAS SURE TO BE ELECTED BUT THE COMMITTEE PROPOSE TO SACRIFICE HIM IN ORDER TO ALECK HOPKINS 
lbi-6829-68771-0005 THE ONLY THING NECESSARY WAS TO FIX SETH REYNOLDS AND THIS HOPKINS ARRANGED PERSONALLY 
lbi-6829-68771-0006 AND THIS WAS WHY KENNETH AND BETH DISCOVERED HIM CONVERSING WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE BUGGY 
lbi-6829-68771-0007 THE DESCRIPTION SHE GAVE OF THE COMING RECEPTION TO THE WOMEN'S POLITICAL LEAGUE WAS SO HUMOROUS AND DIVERTING THAT THEY WERE BOTH LAUGHING HEARTILY OVER THE THING WHEN THE YOUNG PEOPLE PASSED THEM AND THUS MISTER HOPKINS FAILED TO NOTICE WHO THE OCCUPANTS OF THE OTHER VEHICLE WERE 
lbi-6829-68771-0008 THESE WOMEN WERE FLATTERED BY THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG LADY AND HAD PROMISED TO ASSIST IN ELECTING MISTER FORBES 
lbi-6829-68771-0009 LOUISE HOPED FOR EXCELLENT RESULTS FROM THIS ORGANIZATION AND WISHED THE ENTERTAINMENT TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN WINNING THEIR GOODWILL THAT THEY WOULD WORK EARNESTLY FOR THE CAUSE IN WHICH THEY WERE ENLISTED 
lbi-6829-68771-0010 THE FAIRVIEW BAND WAS ENGAGED TO DISCOURSE AS MUCH HARMONY AS IT COULD PRODUCE AND THE RESOURCES OF THE GREAT HOUSE WERE TAXED TO ENTERTAIN THE GUESTS 
lbi-6829-68771-0011 TABLES WERE SPREAD ON THE LAWN AND A DAINTY BUT SUBSTANTIAL REPAST WAS TO BE SERVED 
lbi-6829-68771-0012 THIS WAS THE FIRST OCCASION WITHIN A GENERATION WHEN SUCH AN ENTERTAINMENT HAD BEEN GIVEN AT ELMHURST AND THEY ONLY WHEN WITHIN THE MEMORY OF MAN WHERE THE NEIGHBOURS AND COUNTRY PEOPLE HAD BEEN THE INVITED GUESTS 
lbi-6829-68771-0013 THE ATTENDANCE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY LARGE AND THE GIRLS WERE DELIGHTED FORESEEING GREAT SUCCESS FURTHER FIGHT 
lbi-6829-68771-0014 WE OUGHT TO HAVE MORE ATTENDANTS BETH SAID LOUISE APPROACHING HER COUSIN 
lbi-6829-68771-0015 WON'T YOU RUN INTO THE HOUSE AND SEE IF MARTHA CAN SPARE ONE OR TWO MORE MAIDS 
lbi-6829-68771-0016 SHE WAS VERY FOND OF THE YOUNG LADIES WHOM SHE HAD KNOWN WHEN AUNT JANE WAS THEIR MISTRESS HERE AND BETH WAS HER SPECIAL FAVORITE 
lbi-6829-68771-0017 THE HOUSEKEEPER LED THE WAY AND BETH FOLLOWED 
lbi-6829-68771-0018 FOR A MOMENT BETH STOOD STARING WHILE THE NEW MAID REGARDED HER WITH COMPOSURE AND A SLIGHT SMILE UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FACE 
lbi-6829-68771-0019 SHE WAS DRESSED IN THE REGULATION COSTUME OF THE MAIDS AT ELMHURST A PLAIN BLACK GOWN WITH A WHITE APRON AND CAP 
lbi-6829-68771-0020 THEN SHE GAVE A LITTLE LAUGH AND REPLIED NO MISS BETH I'M ELIZABETH PARSONS 
lbi-6829-68771-0021 BUT IT CAN'T BE PROTESTED THE GIRL 
lbi-6829-68771-0022 I ATTEND TO THE HOUSEHOLD MENDING YOU KNOW AND CARE FOR THE LINEN 
lbi-6829-68771-0023 YOU SPEAK LIKE AN EDUCATED PERSON SAID BETH WONDERINGLY WHERE'S YOUR HOME 
lbi-6829-68771-0024 FOR THE FIRST TIME THE MAID SEEMED A LITTLE CONFUSED AND HER GAZE WANDERED FROM THE FACE OF HER VISITOR 
lbi-6829-68771-0025 SHE SAT DOWN IN A ROCKING CHAIR AND CLASPING HER HANDS IN HER LAP ROCKED SLOWLY BACK AND FORTH I'M SORRY SAID BETH 
lbi-6829-68771-0026 ELIZA PARSONS SHOOK HER HEAD 
lbi-6829-68771-0027 FATE THEY EXCITE ME IN SOME WAY AND I I CAN'T BEAR THEM YOU MUST EXCUSE ME 
lbi-6829-68771-0028 SHE EVEN SEEMED MILDLY AMUSED AT THE ATTENTION SHE ATTRACTED 
lbi-6829-68771-0029 BETH WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL THE HANDSOMEST OF THE THREE COUSINS BY FAR YET ELIZA SURPASSED HER AND NATURAL CHARM AND SEEMED WELL AWARE OF THE FACT 
lbi-6829-68771-0030 HER MANNER WAS NEITHER INDEPENDENT NOR ASSERTIVE BUT RATHER ONE OF WELL BRED COMPOSURE AND CALM RELIANCE 
lbi-6829-68771-0031 HER EYES WANDERED TO THE MAID'S HANDS 
lbi-6829-68771-0032 HOWEVER HER FEATURES AND FORM MIGHT REPRESS ANY EVIDENCE OF NERVOUSNESS THESE HANDS TOLD A DIFFERENT STORY 
lbi-6829-68771-0033 SHE ROSE QUICKLY TO HER FEET WITH AN IMPETUOUS GESTURE THAT MADE HER VISITOR CATCH HER BREATH 
lbi-6829-68771-0034 I WISH I KNEW MYSELF SHE CRIED FIERCELY 
lbi-6829-68771-0035 WILL YOU LEAVE ME ALONE IN MY OWN ROOM OR MUST I GO AWAY TO ESCAPE YOU 
lbi-6829-68771-0036 ELIZA CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER WITH A DECIDED SLAM AND A KEY CLICKED IN THE LOCK 
lbi-6930-75918-0000 CONCORD RETURNED TO ITS PLACE AMIDST THE TENTS 
lbi-6930-75918-0001 THE ENGLISH FORWARDED TO THE FRENCH BASKETS OF FLOWERS OF WHICH THEY HAD MADE A PLENTIFUL PROVISION TO GREET THE ARRIVAL OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS THE FRENCH IN RETURN INVITED THE ENGLISH TO A SUPPER WHICH WAS TO BE GIVEN THE NEXT DAY 
lbi-6930-75918-0002 CONGRATULATIONS WERE POURED IN UPON THE PRINCESS EVERYWHERE DURING HER JOURNEY 
lbi-6930-75918-0003 FROM THE RESPECT PAID HER ON ALL SIDES SHE SEEMED LIKE A QUEEN AND FROM THE ADORATION WITH WHICH SHE WAS TREATED BY TWO OR THREE SHE APPEARED AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP THE QUEEN MOTHER GAVE THE FRENCH THE MOST AFFECTIONATE RECEPTION FRANCE WAS HER NATIVE COUNTRY AND SHE HAS SUFFERED TOO MUCH UNHAPPINESS IN ENGLAND FOR ENGLAND TO HAVE MADE HER FORGET FRANCE 
lbi-6930-75918-0004 SHE TAUGHT HER DAUGHTER THAN BY HER OWN AFFECTION FOR THAT LOVE FOR A COUNTRY WHERE THEY HAD BOTH BEEN HOSPITABLY RECEIVED AND WHERE A BRILLIANT FUTURE OPENED FOR THEM 
lbi-6930-75918-0005 THEY COUNT HAD THROWN HIMSELF BACK ON HIS SEAT LEANING HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE PARTITION OF THE TENT AND REMAINED THUS HIS FACE BURIED IN HIS HANDS WITH HEAVING CHEST AND RESTLESS LIMBS 
lbi-6930-75918-0006 THIS HAS INDEED BEEN A HARASSING DAY CONTINUED THE YOUNG MAN HIS EYES FIXED UPON HIS FRIEND 
lbi-6930-75918-0007 YOU WILL BE FRANK WITH ME I ALWAYS AM 
lbi-6930-75918-0008 CAN YOU IMAGINE MY BUCKINGHAM HAS BEEN SO VIOLENT I SUSPECT 
lbi-6930-75918-0009 IT IS YOU WERE MISTAKEN ROLE I HAVE READ HIS DISTRESS IN HIS EYES IN HIS EVERY GESTURE AND ACTION THE WHOLE DAY 
lbi-6930-75918-0010 I CAN PERCEIVE LOVE CLEARLY ENOUGH 
lbi-6930-75918-0011 I AM CONVINCED OF WHAT I SAY SAID THE COUNT 
lbi-6930-75918-0012 IT IS AN ANNOYANCE THEN 
lbi-6930-75918-0013 IN THOSE VERY TERMS I EVEN HAD IT MORE 
lbi-6930-75918-0014 BUT CONTINUED RAOUL NOT INTERRUPTED BY THIS MOVEMENT OF HIS FRIEND HEAVEN BE PRAISED THE FRENCH WHO ARE PRONOUNCED TO BE THOUGHTLESS AND INDISCREET RECKLESS EVEN ARE CAPABLE OF BRINGING A CALM AND SOUND JUDGMENT TO BEAR ON MATTERS OF SUCH HIGH IMPORTANCE 
lbi-6930-75918-0015 THUS IT IS THAT THE HONOUR OF THREE IS SAVED OUR COUNTRY OUR MASTERS AND OUR OWN 
lbi-6930-75918-0016 YES I NEED REPOSE MANY THINGS HAVE AGITATED ME TODAY BOTH IN MIND AND BODY WHEN YOU RETURN TOMORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE THE SAME MAN 
lbi-6930-75918-0017 BUT IN THIS FRIENDLY PRESSURE RAU COULD DETECT THE NERVOUS AGITATION OF A GREAT INTERNAL CONFLICT 
lbi-6930-75918-0018 THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR STARLIGHT AND SPLENDID THE TEMPEST HAD PASSED AWAY AND THE SWEET INFLUENCES OF THE EVENING HAD RESTORED LIFE PEACE AND SECURITY EVERYWHERE 
lbi-6930-75918-0019 UPON THE LARGE SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL THE SHADOWS OF THE TENTS INTERSECTED BY THE GOLDEN MOONBEAMS FORMED AS IT WERE A HUGE MOSAIC OF JET AND YELLOW FLAG STONES 
lbi-6930-75918-0020 BRIDLE ON WATCHED FOR SOME TIME THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO LOVERS LISTENED TO THE LOUD AN UNCIVIL SLUMBERS OF MANNA CAMP WHO SNORED AS IMPERIOUSLY AS THOUGH HE WAS WEARING HIS BLUE AND GOLD INSTEAD OF HIS VIOLETS SUIT 
lbi-6930-76324-0000 GOLIATH MAKES ANOTHER DISCOVERY 
lbi-6930-76324-0001 THERE WERE CERTAINLY NO NEARER THE SOLUTION OF THEIR PROBLEM 
lbi-6930-76324-0002 THE POOR LITTLE THINGS CRIED CYNTHIA THINK OF THEM HAVING BEEN TURNED TO THE WALL ALL THESE YEARS 
lbi-6930-76324-0003 NOW WHAT IS THE SENSE OF IT TO INNOCENT BABIES LIKE THAT 
lbi-6930-76324-0004 BUT JOYCE HAD NOT BEEN LISTENING ALL AT ONCE SHE PUT DOWN HER CANDLE ON THE TABLE AND FACED HER COMPANION 
lbi-6930-76324-0005 THE TWIN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DIDN'T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICTURE TO THE WALL 
lbi-6930-76324-0006 HERS HAPPENED TO BE ON THE SAME FRAME TO BUT SHE EVIDENTLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT IT 
lbi-6930-76324-0007 NOW WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY CYNTHIA SPRAGG 
lbi-6930-76324-0008 I THOUGHT WE WERE STUMPED AGAIN WHEN I FIRST SAW THE PICTURE BUT IT HAS BEEN OF SOME USE AFTER ALL 
lbi-6930-76324-0009 DO YOU SUPPOSE THE MANAGER WAS A COPY OF THE SAME THING 
lbi-6930-76324-0010 WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THE QUEERY CHOICE 
lbi-6930-76324-0011 THEY WERE IN ME TERRIBLY AND BESIDES I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THIS LOVELY FURNITURE LOOKS LIKE WITHOUT SUCH QUANTITIES OF DUST ALL OVER IT GOOD SCHEME SIM 
lbi-6930-76324-0012 WELL COME IN HERE THIS AFTERNOON WITH OLD CLOTHES ON AND HAVE A REGULAR HOUSE CLEANING 
lbi-6930-76324-0013 IT CAN'T HURT ANYTHING I'M SURE FOR WE WILL DISTURB THINGS AT ALL 
lbi-6930-76324-0014 THIS THOUGHT HOWEVER DID NOT ENTER THE HEADS OF THE ENTHUSIASTIC PAIR 
lbi-6930-76324-0015 SMUGGLING THE HOUSE CLEANING PARAPHERNALIA INTO THE CELLAR WINDOW UNOBSERVED THAT AFTERNOON PROVED NO EASY TASK FOR CYNTHIA HAD ADDED A WHISK BROOM AND DUST PAN TO THE OUTFIT 
lbi-6930-76324-0016 THE LOWER PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE CAME SPORTING AFTER A S FRISKILY AS A YOUNG KITTEN MUCH TO CYNTHIA'S DELIGHT WHEN SHE CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM 
lbi-6930-76324-0017 OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE URGED I D LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSE 
lbi-6930-76324-0018 HE MAKES IT SORT OF COSY HERE 
lbi-6930-76324-0019 NOW LET'S DUST THE FURNITURE AND PICTURES 
lbi-6930-76324-0020 YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT OF THE ROOM 
lbi-6930-76324-0021 SURFACE DUST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THE FINE OLD FURNITURE GAVE A HINT OF ITS REAL ELEGANCE AND POLISH 
lbi-6930-76324-0022 THEN SHE SUDDENLY REMARKED 
lbi-6930-76324-0023 AND MY POCKET MONEY WAS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVEN'T ANY LAUGHED AS USUAL 
lbi-6930-76324-0024 THEY SAY ILLUMINATION BY CANDLE LIGHT IS THE PRETTIEST IN THE WORLD 
lbi-6930-76324-0025 WHY IT'S GOLIATH AS USUAL THEY BOTH CRIED PEERING IN 
lbi-6930-76324-0026 ISN'T HE THE GREATEST FOR GETTING INTO ODD CORNERS 
lbi-6930-76324-0027 FORGETTING ALL THEIR WEARINESS THEY SEIZED THEIR CANDLES AND SCURRIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FINDING ON OCCASIONAL PAPER TUCKED AWAY IN SOME ODD CORNER 
lbi-6930-76324-0028 WELL I'M CONVINCED AT THE BOARDED UP HOUSE MYSTERY HAPPENED NOT EARLIER THAN APRIL SIXTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE AND PROBABLY NOT MUCH LATER 
lbi-6930-81414-0000 NO WORDS WERE SPOKEN NO LANGUAGE WAS UTTERED SAVE THAT OF WAILING AND HISSING AND THAT SOMEHOW WAS INDISTINCT AS IF IT EXISTED IN FANCY AND NOT IN REALITY 
lbi-6930-81414-0001 I HEARD A NOISE BEHIND ME I TURNED AND SAW A CALF FOR HIS BLACK EYES SHINING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GLEAMING KNIFE HE LIFTED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRIKE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HURLED HIM FROM ME 
lbi-6930-81414-0002 HONOR SAID A DISTANT VOICE 
lbi-6930-81414-0003 NO SOUND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT 
lbi-6930-81414-0004 THE STORY OF ITS EVIL INFLUENCE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BEWILDERED CONDITION I WONDERED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID 
lbi-6930-81414-0005 WHAT WAS THAT 
lbi-6930-81414-0006 WHY THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE UNSHAPELY APPEARED DISTINCTLY ON THE SURFACE OF THE POND 
lbi-6930-81414-0007 NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE RISKS TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATTACHED 
lbi-6930-81414-0008 IT DID NOT BECKON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH 
lbi-6930-81414-0009 I AWOKE TO CONSCIOUSNESS FIGHTING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHTING WITH THE PHANTOM BUT GRADUALLY MY OPPONENT BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS KAFFER 
lbi-6930-81414-0010 A SOUND OF VOICES A FLASH OF LIGHT 
lbi-6930-81414-0011 A FEELING OF FREEDOM AND I WAS AWAKE WHERE 
lbi-6930-81414-0012 SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECOGNISED AS VOLTAIRE'S KAFFER 
lbi-6930-81414-0013 I HAD SCARCELY KNOWN WHERE I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND 
lbi-6930-81414-0014 IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KNIFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISCOLOURED 
lbi-6930-81414-0015 I DO NOT KNOW I AM DAZED BEWILDERED 
lbi-6930-81414-0016 BUT THAT IS CAFFRES KNIFE 
lbi-6930-81414-0017 I KNOW HE HAD IT THIS VERY EVENING 
lbi-6930-81414-0018 I REMEMBER SAYING HAVE WE BEEN TOGETHER 
lbi-6930-81414-0019 WHILE CHAIR PICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT 
lbi-6930-81414-0020 I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US 
lbi-6930-81414-0021 A TERRIBLE THOUGHT FLASHED INTO MY MIND 
lbi-6930-81414-0022 I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACTING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS MAN'S POWER 
lbi-6930-81414-0023 PERCHANCE TWO CAFFRES DEATH MIGHT SERVE HIM IN GOOD STEAD 
lbi-6930-81414-0024 MY TONGUE REFUSED TO ARTICULATE MY POWER OF SPEECH LEFT ME 
lbi-6930-81414-0025 MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRIBLE 
lbi-6930-81414-0026 MY OVERWROUGHT NERVES YIELDED AT LAST 
lbi-6930-81414-0027 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBERED NOTHING DISTINCTLY 
lbi-7021-79730-0000 THE THREE MODES OF MANAGEMENT 
lbi-7021-79730-0001 TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO AID IN EFFECTING SUCH A SUBSTITUTION AS THAT IS ENTIRELY TO MISTAKE ITS NATURE AND DESIGN 
lbi-7021-79730-0002 BY REASON AND AFFECTION 
lbi-7021-79730-0003 AS THE CHASE DRIVES AWAY MARY STANDS BEWILDERED AND PERPLEXED ON THE DOORSTEP HER MIND IN A TUMULT OF EXCITEMENT IN WHICH HATRED OF THE DOCTOR DISTRUST AND SUSPICION OF HER MOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT VEXATION AND ILL HUMOUR SURGE AND SWELL AMONG THOSE DELICATE ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSELY DEPEND DURING PERHAPS AN IRREPARABLE INJURY 
lbi-7021-79730-0004 THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CHASE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY COULD NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESSION OF OUR CONTINENTS GOES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMPLACENCY AND SATISFACTION ON HER FACE AT THE INGENUITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ARTIFICE 
lbi-7021-79730-0005 SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONTENTEDLY WON'T YOU 
lbi-7021-79730-0006 THE MOTHER IN MANAGING THE CASE IN THIS WAY RELIES PARTLY ON CONVINCING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PARTLY ON AN APPEAL TO HER AFFECTION 
lbi-7021-79730-0007 IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGNS OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOMEWHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE 
lbi-7021-79730-0008 BUT THIS LAST SUPPOSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS A NECESSARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HABITUALLY MANAGED ON THIS PRINCIPLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE 
lbi-7021-79730-0009 IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT AND SKILL IN THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG AND OF CULTIVATING THEIR REASON AND SECURING THEIR AFFECTION CANNOT BE OVERRATED 
lbi-7021-79740-0000 TO SUCH PERSONS THESE INDIRECT MODES OF TRAINING CHILDREN IN HABITS OF SUBORDINATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF YIELDING TO THEIR INFLUENCE ARE SPECIALLY USEFUL 
lbi-7021-79740-0001 DELLA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAMED MARIA AND A COUSIN WHOSE NAME WAS JANE 
lbi-7021-79740-0002 NOW JULIA CONTRIVED TO OBTAIN A GREAT INFLUENCE AND ASCENDENCY OVER THE MINDS OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DOLLS 
lbi-7021-79740-0003 TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERSATIONS I WILL REPORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL 
lbi-7021-79740-0004 YOU HAVE COME AND DELLA AND DELLA WAS THE NAME OF JAMES DOLL TO MAKE ROSALIA VISIT 
lbi-7021-79740-0005 I AM VERY GLAD 
lbi-7021-79740-0006 I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL AND DELLA SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST 
lbi-7021-79740-0007 THEN TURNING TO JANE SHE ASKED IN A SOMEWHAT ALTERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL JANE 
lbi-7021-79740-0008 FOR INSTANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAYING UPON THE PIAZZA WITH BLOCKS AND OTHER PLAYTHINGS AND FINALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEAVING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE PIAZZA INSTEAD OF PUTTING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACES AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE 
lbi-7021-79740-0009 THEY WERE NOW PLAYING WITH THEIR DOLLS IN THE PARLOR 
lbi-7021-79740-0010 DELIA CAME TO THE PARLOUR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MYSTERY BECKONED THE CHILDREN ASIDE AND SET THEM IN A WHISPER LEAVE AND DELLA AND ROSALIE HERE AND DON'T SAY A WORD TO THEM 
lbi-7021-79740-0011 SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON TIPTOE FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO THE PIAZZA THERE 
lbi-7021-79740-0012 SAID SHE POINTING TO THE PLAYTHINGS SEE 
lbi-7021-79740-0013 PUT THESE PLAYTHINGS ALL AWAY QUICK AND CAREFULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR LEAVING THEM OUT 
lbi-7021-79740-0014 AND THIS METHOD OF TREATING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECTUAL IN MAKING THEM DISPOSED TO AVOID COMMITTING A SIMILAR FAULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT REBUKES OR EXPRESSIONS OF DISPLEASURE ADDRESSED PERSONALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN 
lbi-7021-79759-0000 NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY EARLY IMPRESSIONS 
lbi-7021-79759-0001 THAT IS COMPARATIVELY NOTHING 
lbi-7021-79759-0002 THEY ARE CHIEFLY FORMED FROM COMBINATIONS OF THE IMPRESSIONS MADE IN CHILDHOOD 
lbi-7021-79759-0003 VAST IMPORTANCE AND INFLUENCE OF THIS MENTAL FURNISHING 
lbi-7021-79759-0004 WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXTREME AS THIS WE CAN EASILY SEE ON REFLECTION HOW VAST AN INFLUENCE ON THE IDEAS AND CONCEPTIONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCIPLES OF ACTION IN MATURE YEARS MUST BE EXERTED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAGES WHICH THE PERIOD OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD IMPRESS UPON THE MIND 
lbi-7021-79759-0005 THE PAIN PRODUCED BY AN ACT OF HASTY AND ANGRY VIOLENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECTS HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEMORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN 
lbi-7021-85628-0000 BUT ANDERS CARED NOTHING ABOUT THAT 
lbi-7021-85628-0001 HE MADE A BOW SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAKING AND HE WAS DUMBFOUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NOBODY BUT ANDERS 
lbi-7021-85628-0002 HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WORE HIGH BOOTS AND CARRIED A JACKKNIFE 
lbi-7021-85628-0003 NOW THIS KNIFE WAS A SPLENDID ONE THOUGH HALF A BLADE WAS GONE AND THE HANDLE WAS A LITTLE CRACKED AND ANDERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A JACKKNIFE 
lbi-7021-85628-0004 YES WHY NOT THOUGHT ANDERS 
lbi-7021-85628-0005 SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING 
lbi-7021-85628-0006 I AM GOING TO THE COURT BALL ANSWERED ANDERS 
lbi-7021-85628-0007 AND SHE TOOK ANDREW'S HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BROAD MARBLE STAIRS WHERE SOLDIERS WERE POSTED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT HALLS WHERE COURTIERS IN SILK AND VELVET STOOD BOWING WHEREVER HE WENT 
lbi-7021-85628-0008 FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP 
lbi-7021-85628-0009 AT THE FARTHER END OF THE LARGEST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLDEN CUPS AND GOLDEN PLATES IN LONG ROWS 
lbi-7021-85628-0010 ON HUGE SILVER PLATTERS WERE PYRAMIDS OF TARTS AND CAKES AND RED WINE SPARKLED IN GLITTERING DECANTERS 
lbi-7021-85628-0011 THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CANOPY WITH BOUQUETS OF ROSES AND SHEILA AND SIT IN A GOLDEN CHAIR BY HER SIDE 
lbi-7021-85628-0012 BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF 
lbi-7021-85628-0013 THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEARLY LIKED TO BE KISSED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY CONDITION 
lbi-7021-85628-0014 HE ONLY SHOOK HIS HEAD 
lbi-7021-85628-0015 WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCKETS WITH CAKES AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK AND BENT DOWN AND KISSED HIM 
lbi-7021-85628-0016 THAT IS A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID 
lbi-7021-85628-0017 SO IT IS SAID ANDERS 
lbi-7021-85628-0018 AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER'S BEST YARN AND SHE KNITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME 
lbi-7021-85628-0019 WITH ONE JUMP AND HER'S GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR 
lbi-7021-85628-0020 HE DARTED LIKE AN ARROW THROUGH ALL THE HALLS DOWN ALL THE STAIRS AND ACROSS THE YARD 
lbi-7021-85628-0021 HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RUSHED INTO HIS MOTHER'S COTTAGE 
lbi-7021-85628-0022 AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS STOOD ROUND AND LISTENED WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN 
lbi-7021-85628-0023 BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REFUSED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING'S GOLDEN CROWN HE SAID THAT ANDERS WAS A STUPID 
lbi-7021-85628-0024 ANDREW'S FACE GREW RED 
lbi-7021-85628-0025 BUT HIS MOTHER HUGGED HIM CLOSE 
lbi-7021-85628-0026 NO MY LITTLE FUN SHE SAID 
lbi-7021-85628-0027 IF YOU DRESSED IN SILK AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TOE YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY NICER THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP 
lbi-7127-75946-0000 AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE BANQUET WHICH WAS SERVED AT FIVE O'CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CABINET WHERE HIS TAILORS ARE AWAITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING ON THE CELEBRATED COSTUME REPRESENTING SPRING WHICH WAS THE RESULT OF SO MUCH IMAGINATION AND HAD COST SO MANY EFFORTS OF THOUGHT TO THE DESIGNERS AND ORNAMENT WORKERS OF THE COURT 
lbi-7127-75946-0001 AH VERY WELL 
lbi-7127-75946-0002 LET EM COME ON THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COLBERT HAD BEEN LISTENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEPING HIMSELF ARE CURRENT WITH THE CONVERSATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRONOUNCED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURTIERS 
lbi-7127-75946-0003 GENTLEMEN TO YOUR POSTS WHEREUPON SAINT AND YAWN AND DEALER I TOOK THEIR LEAVE 
lbi-7127-75946-0004 CERTAINLY SIR BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHAT 
lbi-7127-75946-0005 WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQUIRED LUIS 
lbi-7127-75946-0006 HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED WHICH WAS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT 
lbi-7127-75946-0007 IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMPLY WITH THE KING FROWNED 
lbi-7127-75946-0008 DOES YOUR MAJESTY THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THAT DISLOYAL ATTEMPT 
lbi-7127-75946-0009 NOT AT ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTRARY MOST AGREEABLE TO ME 
lbi-7127-75946-0010 YOUR MAJESTY'S PLAN THEN IN THIS AFFAIR IS 
lbi-7127-75946-0011 YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE 
lbi-7127-75946-0012 THE NEWS CIRCULATED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING DURING ITS PROGRESS IT KINDLED EVERY VARIETY OF COQUETRY DESIRE AND WILD AMBITION 
lbi-7127-75946-0013 THE KING HAD COMPLETED HIS TOILET BY NINE O'CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CARRIAGE DECORATED WITH BRANCHES OF TREES AND FLOWERS 
lbi-7127-75946-0014 THE QUEENS HAD TAKEN THEIR SEATS UPON A MAGNIFICENT DEUS OR PLATFORM ERECTED UPON THE BORDERS OF THE LAKE IN A THEATRE OF WONDERFUL ELEGANCE OF CONSTRUCTION 
lbi-7127-75946-0015 SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESTORING PEACE AND ORDER SPRING ACCOMPANIED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEARANCE 
lbi-7127-75946-0016 THE SEASON'S ALLIES OF SPRING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSELY TO FORM A QUADRILLE WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FLATTERING IMPORT WAS THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE DANCE 
lbi-7127-75946-0017 HIS LEGS THE BEST SHAPED AT COURT WERE DISPLAYED TO GREAT ADVANTAGE IN FLESH COLOURED SILKEN HOSE OF SILK SO FINE AND SO TRANSPARENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLESH ITSELF 
lbi-7127-75946-0018 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CARRIAGE WHICH RESEMBLED THE BUOYANT MOVEMENTS OF AN IMMORTAL AND HE DID NOT DANCE SO MUCH AS SEEM TO SOAR ALONG 
lbi-7127-75946-0019 YES IT IS SUPPRESSED 
lbi-7127-75946-0020 FAR FROM IT SIRE YOUR MAJESTY HAVING GIVEN NO DIRECTIONS ABOUT IT THE MUSICIANS HAVE RETAINED AN 
lbi-7127-75946-0021 YES SIRE AND READY DRESSED FOR THE BALLET 
lbi-7127-75946-0022 SIRE HE SAID YOUR MAJESTY'S MOST DEVOTED SERVANT APPROACHES TO PERFORM A SERVICE ON THIS OCCASION WITH SIMILAR ZEAL THAT HE HAS ALREADY SHOWN ON THE FIELD OF BATTLE 
lbi-7127-75946-0023 THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASED WITH EVERY ONE PRESENT 
lbi-7127-75946-0024 MONSIEUR WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER 
lbi-7127-75946-0025 THE BALLET BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL 
lbi-7127-75946-0026 WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATRE SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE 
lbi-7127-75946-0027 DISDAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARK AND PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS 
lbi-7127-75946-0028 BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPIFIED 
lbi-7127-75946-0029 THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN THE QUADRILLE CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL 
lbi-7127-75947-0000 EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BE DEMMED 
lbi-7127-75947-0001 UPON THIS MADAME DEIGNED TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE COMTE OBSERVING 
lbi-7127-75947-0002 DO YOU THINK SO SHE REPLIED WITH INDIFFERENCE 
lbi-7127-75947-0003 YES THE CHARACTER WHICH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS ASSUMED IS IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH YOUR OWN 
lbi-7127-75947-0004 EXPLAIN YOURSELF 
lbi-7127-75947-0005 I ALLUDE TO THE GODDESS 
lbi-7127-75947-0006 THE PRINCESS INQUIRED NO 
lbi-7127-75947-0007 SHE THEN ROSE HUMMING THE AIR TO WHICH SHE WAS PRESENTLY GOING TO DANCE 
lbi-7127-75947-0008 THE ARROW PIERCED HIS HEART AND WOUNDED HIM MORTALLY 
lbi-7127-75947-0009 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATRE BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART 
lbi-7127-75947-0010 WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THE YOUNG MAN SHE ROSE LIKE A WOMAN SURPRISED IN THE MIDST OF IDEAS SHE WAS DESIROUS OF CONCEALING FROM HERSELF

lbi-7127-75947-0026 WELL SAID MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY SHOD I ALSO THINK A GOOD DEAL BUT I TAKE CARE 
lbi-7127-75947-0027 TO SAY NOTHING SAID MONTALAIS SO THAT WHEN MADEMOISELLE DE TONNAY CHARENTE THINKS ATHENAIS IS THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS IT 
lbi-7127-75947-0028 QUICK QUICK THEN AMONG THE HIGH REED GRASS SAID MONTALAIS STOOP ETHIE NAY YOU ARE SO TALL

lbi-7127-75947-0035 GOOD GRACIOUS HAS THE KING ANY RIGHT TO INTERFERE IN MATTERS OF THAT KIND 
lbi-7127-75947-0036 I GIVE MY CONSENT 
lbi-7127-75947-0037 OH I AM SPEAKING SERIOUSLY REPLIED MONTALAIS AND MY OPINION IN THIS CASE IS QUITE AS GOOD AS THE KING'S I SUPPOSE IS IT NOT LOUISE 
lbi-7127-75947-0038 LET US RUN THEN SET ALL THREE AND GRACEFULLY LIFTING UP THE LONG SKIRTS OF THEIR SILK DRESSES THEY LIGHTLY RAN ACROSS THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE LAKE AND THE THICKEST COVERTS OF THE PARK 
lbi-7127-75947-0039 IN FACT THE SOUND OF MADAME AND THE QUEEN'S CARRIAGES COULD BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE UPON THE HARD DRY GROUND OF THE ROADS FOLLOWED BY THE MOUNTED CAVALIERS 
lbi-7127-75947-0040 IN THIS WAY THE HEAD OF THE WHOLE COURT WAS A FAT ALSO FOR THE MYSTERIOUS INHABITANTS OF THE FOREST FOR CERTAINLY THE DEER IN THE BRAKE THE PHEASANT ON THE BRANCH THE FOX IN ITS HALL WERE ALL LISTENING 
lbi-7176-88083-0000 ALL ABOUT HIM WAS A TUMULT OF BRIGHT UNBROKEN COLOR SCATTERED AND BROAD SPLASHES 
lbi-7176-88083-0001 THE MERGANSER HAD A CRESTED HEAD OF IRIDESCENT GREEN BLACK A BROAD COLLAR OF LUSTROUS WHITE BLACK BLACK BLACK AND WHITE WINGS WHITE BELLY SIDES FINELY PENCILLED IN BLACK AND WHITE AND ABREAST OF RICH CHESTNUT RED STREAKED WITH BLACK 
lbi-7176-88083-0002 HIS FEET WERE RED HIS LONG NARROW BEAK WITH ITS SAW TOOTHED EDGES AND SHARP HOOKED TIP WAS BRIGHT RED 
lbi-7176-88083-0003 BUT HERE HE WAS AT A TERRIBLE DISADVANTAGE AS COMPARED WITH THE OWLS HAWKS AND EAGLES HE HAD NO RENDING CLAWS 
lbi-7176-88083-0004 BUT SUDDENLY STRAIGHT AND SWIFT AS A DIVING CORMORANT HE SHOT DOWN INTO THE TORRENT AND DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE SURFACE 
lbi-7176-88083-0005 ONCE FAIRLY A WING HOWEVER HE WHEELED AND MADE BACK HURRIEDLY FOR HIS PERCH 
lbi-7176-88083-0006 IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED THAT A TROUT OF THIS SIZE WAS A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL MEAL 
lbi-7176-88083-0007 BUT SUCH WAS HIS KEENNESS THAT EVEN WHILE THE WIDE FLUKES OF HIS ENGORGED VICTIM WERE STILL STICKING OUT OF THE CORNERS OF HIS BEAK HIS FIERCE RED EYES WERE ONCE MORE PEERING DOWNWARD INTO THE TORRENT IN SEARCH OF FRESH PREY 
lbi-7176-88083-0008 IN DESPAIR HE HURLED HIMSELF DOWNWARD TOO SOON 
lbi-7176-88083-0009 THE GREAT HAWK FOLLOWED HURRIEDLY TO RETRIEVE HIS PREY FROM THE GROUND 
lbi-7176-88083-0010 THE CAT GROWLED SOFTLY PICKED UP THE PRIZE IN HER JEWELS AND TROTTED INTO THE BUSHES TO DEVOUR IT 
lbi-7176-88083-0011 IN FACT HE HAD JUST FINISHED THE LAST OF THE TROUT'S TAIL HAD JUST VANISHED WITH A SPASM DOWN HIS STRAINED GULLET WHEN THE BAFFLED HAWK CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM AND SWOOPED 
lbi-7176-88083-0012 THE HAWK ALIGHTED ON THE DEAD BRANCH AND SAT UPRIGHT MOTIONLESS AS IF SURPRISED 
lbi-7176-88083-0013 LIKE HIS UNFORTUNATE LITTLE COUSIN TILL HE TOO HAD FELT THE FEAR OF DEATH SMITTEN INTO HIS HEART AND WAS HEADING DESPERATELY FOR THE REFUGE OF SOME DARK OVERHANGING BANK DEEP FRINGED WITH WEEDS WHERE THE DREADFUL EYE OF THE HAWK SHOULD NOT DISCERN HIM 
lbi-7176-88083-0014 THE HAWK SAT UPON THE BRANCH AND WATCHED HIS QUARRY SWIMMING BENEATH THE SURFACE 
lbi-7176-88083-0015 ALMOST INSTANTLY HE WAS FORCED TO THE TOP 
lbi-7176-88083-0016 STRAIGHTWAY THE HAWK GLIDED FROM HIS PERCH AND DARTED AFTER HIM 
lbi-7176-88083-0017 BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE RAPIDS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO STAY DOWN 
lbi-7176-88083-0018 BUT THIS FREQUENTER OF THE HEIGHTS OF AIR FOR ALL HIS SAVAGE VALOUR WAS TROUBLED AT THE LEAPING WAVES AND THE TOSSING FOAM OF THESE MAD RAPIDS HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THEM 
lbi-7176-88083-0019 AS HE FLEW HIS DOWN REACHING CLUTCHING TALONS WERE NOT HALF A YARD ABOVE THE FUGITIVE'S HEAD 
lbi-7176-88083-0020 WHERE THE WAVES FOR AN INSTANT SANK THEY CAME CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE WITHIN GRASPING REACH 
lbi-7176-88083-0021 BUT AS BEFORE THE LEAPING WAVES AT THE RAPIDS WERE TOO MUCH FOR HIS PURSUER AND HE WAS ABLE TO FLAP HIS WAY ONWARD IN A CLOUD OF FOAM BORE DOOM HUNG LOW ABOVE HIS HEAD YET HESITATED TO STRIKE 
lbi-7176-88083-0022 THE HAWK EMBITTERED BY THE LOSS OF HIS FIRST QUARRY HAD BECOME AS DOGS IN PURSUIT AS A WEASEL NOT TO BE SHAKEN OFF OR EVADED OR DECEIVED 
lbi-7176-88083-0023 HE HAD A LOT OF LINE OUT AND THE PLACE WAS NONE TOO FREE FOR A LONG CAST BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT TO DROP HIS FLIES AGAIN ON THE SPOT WHERE THE BIG FISH WAS FEEDING 
lbi-7176-88083-0024 THE LAST DROP FLY AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT CAUGHT JUST AROUND THE CORNER OF THE HAWK'S ANGRILY OPEN BEAK HOOKING ITSELF FIRMLY 
lbi-7176-88083-0025 AT THE SUDDEN SHARP STING OF IT THE GREAT BIRD TURNED HIS HEAD AND NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FISHERMAN STANDING ON THE BANK 
lbi-7176-88083-0026 THE DRAG UPON HIS BEAK AND THE LIGHT CHECK UPON HIS WINGS WERE INEXPLICABLE TO HIM AND APPALLING 
lbi-7176-88083-0027 THEN THE LEADER PARTED FROM THE LINE 
lbi-7176-92135-0000 HE'S A WELCOME FIGURE AT THE GARDEN PARTIES OF THE ELECT WHO WERE ALWAYS READY TO ENCOURAGE HIM BY ACCEPTING FREE SEATS FOR HIS PLAY ACTOR MANAGERS NOD TO HIM AND ALLOW HIM TO CONTRIBUTE WITHOUT CHARGE TO A SYMPOSIUM IN THE PRICE OF GOLF BALLS 
lbi-7176-92135-0001 IN SHORT HE BECOMES A PROMINENT FIGURE IN LONDON SOCIETY AND IF HE IS NOT CAREFUL SOMEBODY WILL SAY SO 
lbi-7176-92135-0002 BUT EVEN THE UNSUCCESSFUL DRAMATIST HAS HIS MOMENTS 
lbi-7176-92135-0003 YOUR PLAY MUST BE NOT MERELY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESSFUL ONE 
lbi-7176-92135-0004 FRANKLY I CANNOT ALWAYS SAY 
lbi-7176-92135-0005 BUT SUPPOSE YOU SAID I'M FOND OF WRITING MY PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY MY LETTERS HOME ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR PUNCH 
lbi-7176-92135-0006 I'VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I'D BETTER KEEP THE POT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT 
lbi-7176-92135-0007 ANYHOW IT'S JOLLY EXCITING AND LIKE UNTO THE DIALOGUE ARE RIGHT 
lbi-7176-92135-0008 LEND ME YOUR EAR FOR TEN MINUTES AND YOU SHALL LEARN JUST WHAT STAGE CRAFT IS 
lbi-7176-92135-0009 AND I SHOULD BEGIN WITH A SHORT HOMILY ON SOLILOQUY 
lbi-7176-92135-0010 HAM TO BE OR NOT TO BE 
lbi-7176-92135-0011 NOW THE OBJECT OF THIS SOLILOQUY IS PLAIN 
lbi-7176-92135-0012 INDEED IT WAS LUCIAN MEAN THE KEYNOTE OF HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY A CLEVER PLAYER COULD TO SOME EXTENT INDICATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINES BY A SILENT WORKING OF THE JOB BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE IDLE TO DENY THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINER SHADES OF THE DRAMATIST'S MEANING 
lbi-7176-92135-0013 WE MODERNS IVER SEE THE ABSURDITY OF IT 
lbi-7176-92135-0014 IF IT BE GRANTED FIRST THAT THE THOUGHTS OF A CERTAIN CHARACTER SHOULD BE KNOWN TO THE AUDIENCE AND SECONDLY THAT SOLILOQUY OR THE HABIT OF THINKING ALOUD IS IN OPPOSITION TO MODERN STAGE TECHNIQUE HOW SHALLOW SOLILOQUY BE AVOIDED WITHOUT DAMAGE TO THE PLAY 
lbi-7176-92135-0015 AND SO ON TILL YOU GET TO THE END WHEN OPHELIA MIGHT SAY AH YES OR SOMETHING NON COMMITTAL OF THAT SORT 
lbi-7176-92135-0016 THIS WOULD BE AN EASY WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EASY TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF 
lbi-7176-92135-0017 IN THE OLD BADLY MADE PLAIN IT WAS FREQUENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTERS TO TAKE THE AUDIENCE INTO HIS CONFIDENCE 
lbi-7176-92135-0018 IN THE MODERN WELL CONSTRUCTED PLAY HE SIMPLY RINGS UP AN IMAGINARY CONFEDERATE AND TELLS HIM WHAT HE IS GOING TO DO COULD ANYTHING BE MORE NATURAL

lbi-7176-92135-0026 ENTER HAMLET WITH HIS FAVORITE BOARHOUND 
lbi-7176-92135-0027 LADY LARKSPUR STOPPED SUDDENLY AND TURNED TOWARD HIM

lbi-7176-92135-0033 RELAPSES INTO SILENCE FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING 
lbi-7176-92135-0034 THE DUCHESS OF SOUTH BRIDGE TO LORD REGGIE OH REGGIE WHAT DID YOU SAY 
lbi-7176-92135-0035 THEN LORD TUPPENNY WELL WHAT ABOUT AUCTION 
lbi-7176-92135-0036 THE CROWD DREW OFF LEAVING THE HERO AND HEROINE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STAGE AND THEN YOU CAN BEGIN 
lbi-7176-92135-0037 THEN IS THE TIME TO INTRODUCE A MEAL ON THE STAGE 
lbi-7176-92135-0038 A SAGE MEAL IS POPULAR BECAUSE IT PROVED TO THE AUDIENCE AT THE ACTORS EVEN ONE CALLED CHARLES HAWTREY OR OWEN NARES ARE REAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU AND ME 
lbi-7176-92135-0039 TEA PLEASE MATTHEWS BUTLER IMPASSIVELY 
lbi-7176-92135-0040 HOSTESS REPLACES LUMP AND INCLINES EMPTY TEAPOT OVERTRAINED FIRMAMENT THAN HANDSOME A CUP PAINTED BROWN INSIDE THE CITY SEEING THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE TELESCOPE IN THE UPPER CIRCLE

lbi-7176-92135-0042 IN NOVELS THE HERO HAS OFTEN PUSHED HIS MEALS AWAY UNTASTED BUT NO STRANGER WOULD DO ANYTHING SO UNNATURAL AS THIS 
lbi-7176-92135-0043 TWO LIGHTS ARE MADE AND THE BRIGHTEST CRUMBLED WITH AN AIR OF GREAT EAGERNESS INDEED ONE FEELS THAT IN REAL LIFE THE GUEST WOULD CLUTCH HOLD OF THE FOOTMEN AND SAY HALF I'M OLD CHAP I HAVEN'T NEARLY FINISHED BUT THE ACTOR'S BETTER SCHOOLED THAN THIS 
lbi-7176-92135-0044 BUT IT WAS THE CIGARETTE WHICH CHIEFLY HAS BROUGHT THE MODERN DRAMA TO ITS PRESENT STATE OF PERFECTION 
lbi-7176-92135-0045 LORD JOHN TAKING OUT GOLD CIGARETTE CASE FROM HIS LEFT HAND UPPER WAISTCOAT POCKET 
lbi-7729-102255-0000 THE BOW THIS LEGISLATURE NUMBERED THIRTY SIX MEMBERS 
lbi-7729-102255-0001 THIS WAS AT THE MARCH ELECTION EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE 
lbi-7729-102255-0002 THE SUMMER'S EMIGRATION HOWEVER BEING MAINLY FROM THE FREE STATES GREATLY CHANGE THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS OF THE TWO PARTIES 
lbi-7729-102255-0003 FOR GENERAL SERVICE THEREFORE REQUIRING NO SPECIAL EFFORT THE NUMERICAL STRENGTH OF THE FACTIONS WAS ABOUT EQUAL WHILE ON EXTRA ORDINARY OCCASIONS THE TWO THOUSAND BORDER RUFFIAN RESERVE LYING A LITTLE FARTHER BACK FROM THE STATE LINE COULD AT ANY TIME EASILY TURN THE SCALE 
lbi-7729-102255-0004 THE FREE STATE MEN HAD ONLY THEIR CONVICTIONS THEIR INTELLIGENCE THEIR COURAGE AND THE MORAL SUPPORT OF THE NORTH THE CONSPIRACY HAD A SECRET COMBINATION THE TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS THE LEGISLATURE THE BOGUS LAWS THE COURTS THE MILITIA OFFICERS THE PRESIDENT AND THE ARMY 
lbi-7729-102255-0005 THIS WAS A FORMIDABLE ARRAY OF ADVANTAGES SLAVERY WAS PLAYING WITH LOADED DICE 
lbi-7729-102255-0006 COME IN BY WAY OF THE MISSOURI RIVER TOWNS HE FELL FIRST AMONG BORDER RUFFIAN COMPANIONSHIP AND INFLUENCES AND PERHAPS HAVING HIS INCLINATIONS ALREADY MOULDED BY HIS WASHINGTON INSTRUCTIONS HIS EARLY IMPRESSIONS WERE DECIDEDLY ADVERSE TO THE FREE STATE CAUSE 
lbi-7729-102255-0007 HIS RECEPTION SPEECH AT WESTPORT IN WHICH HE MAINTAINED THE LEGALITY OF THE LEGISLATURE AND HIS DETERMINATION TO ENFORCE THEIR LAWS DELIGHTED HIS PRO SLAVERY AUDITORS 
lbi-7729-102255-0008 ALL THE TERRITORIAL DIGNITARIES WERE PRESENT GOVERNOR SHANNON PRESIDED JOHN CALHOUN THE SURVEYOR GENERAL MADE THE PRINCIPAL SPEECH A DENUNCIATION OF THE ABOLITIONIST SUPPORTING THE TOPEKA MOVEMENT CHIEF JUSTICE LECOMTE DIGNIFY THE OCCASION WITH APPROVING REMARKS 
lbi-7729-102255-0009 ALL DESCEND ON NON COMPLIANCE ALL HESITATION ALL MERE SILENCE EVEN WERE IN THEIR STRONGHOLD TOWNS LIKE LEAVENWORTH BRANDED AS ABOLITIONISM DECLARED TO BE HOSTILITY TO THE PUBLIC WELFARE AND PUNISHED WITH PROSCRIPTION PERSONAL VIOLENCE EXPULSION AND FREQUENTLY DEATH 
lbi-7729-102255-0010 OTHER LYNCHINGS THE MOBS AND THE MURDERERS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE EXCEPT IN A VERY EXTENDED WORK TO NOTE THE FREQUENT AN ATROCIOUS DETAILS 
lbi-7729-102255-0011 THE PRESENT CHAPTERS CAN ONLY TOUCH UPON THE MORE SALIENT MOVEMENTS OF THE CIVIL WAR IN KANSAS WHICH HAPPILY ARE NOT SANGUINARY IF HOWEVER THE INDIVIDUAL AND MORE ISOLATED CASES OF BLOODSHED COULD BE DESCRIBED THEY WOULD SHOW A STARTLING AGGREGATE OF BARBARITY AND A LOSS OF LIFE FOR OPINION'S SAKE 
lbi-7729-102255-0012 SEVERAL HUNDRED FREE STATE MEN PROMPTLY RESPONDED TO THE SUMMONS 
lbi-7729-102255-0013 IT WAS IN FACT THE BEST WEAPON OF ITS DAY 
lbi-7729-102255-0014 THE LEADERS OF THE CONSPIRACY BECAME DISTRUSTFUL OF THEIR POWER TO CRUSH THE TOWN 
lbi-7729-102255-0015 ONE OF HIS MILITIA GENERALS SUGGESTED THAT THE GOVERNOR SHOULD REQUIRE THE OUTLAWS AT LAWRENCE AND ELSEWHERE TO SURRENDER THE SHARP'S RIFLES ANOTHER WROTE ASKING HIM TO CALL OUT THE GOVERNMENT TROOPS AT FORT LEAVENWORTH 
lbi-7729-102255-0016 THE GOVERNOR ON HIS PART BECOMING DOUBTFUL OF THE LEGALITY OF EMPLOYING MISSOURI MILITIA TO ENFORCE KANSAS LAWS WAS ALSO EAGER TO SECURE THE HELP OF FEDERAL TROOPS 
lbi-7729-102255-0017 SHERIFF JONES HAD HIS POCKETS ALWAYS FULL OF WRITS ISSUED IN THE SPIRIT OF PERSECUTION THAT WAS OFTEN BAFFLED BY THE SHARP WITS AND READY RESOURCES OF THE FREE STATE PEOPLE AND SOMETIMES DEFIED OUTRIGHT 
lbi-7729-102255-0018 LITTLE BY LITTLE HOWEVER THE LATTER BECAME DIMMED AND BOUND IN THE MESHES OF THE VARIOUS DEVICES AND PROCEEDINGS WHICH THE TERRITORIAL OFFICIALS EVOLVED FROM THE VULGUS LAWS 
lbi-7729-102255-0019 TO EMBARRASS THIS DAMAGING EXPOSURE JUDGE LECOMTE ISSUED A WRIT AGAINST THE EX GOVERNOR ON A FRIVOLOUS CHARGE OF CONTEMPT 
lbi-7729-102255-0020 THE INCIDENT WAS NOT VIOLENT NOR EVEN DRAMATIC NO POSSE WILL SUMMON NO FURTHER EFFORT MADE AND READER FEARING PERSONAL VIOLENCE SOON FLED IN DISGUISE 
lbi-7729-102255-0021 BUT THE AFFAIR WAS MAGNIFIED AS A CROWNING PROOF THAT THE FREE STATE MEN WERE INSURRECTIONS AND OUTLAWS 
lbi-7729-102255-0022 FROM THESE AGAIN SPRANG BARRICADED AND FORTIFIED DWELLINGS CAMP SINCE COUNT PARTIES FINALLY CULMINATING IN ROVING GUERRILLA BANDS HALF PARTISAN HALF PREDATORY 
lbi-7729-102255-0023 THEIR DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERS HOWEVER DISPLAY ONE BROAD AND UNFAILING DEFERENCE 
lbi-7729-102255-0024 THE FREE STATE MEN CLUNG TO THEIR PRAIRIE TOWNS AND PRAIRIE RAVINES WITH ALL THE OBSTINACY AND COURAGE OF TRUE DEFENDERS OF THEIR HOMES AND FIRESIDES 
lbi-7729-102255-0025 THEIR ASSUMED CHARACTER CHANGED WITH THEIR CHANGING OPPORTUNITIES ARE NECESSITIES 
lbi-7729-102255-0026 IN THE SHOOTING OF SHERIFF JONES AND LAWRENCE AND IN THEIR REFUSAL OF EX GOVERNOR REEDER TO ALLOW THE DEPUTY MARSHAL TO ARREST HIM THEY DISCOVERED GRAVE OFFENCES AGAINST THE TERRITORIAL AND THE UNITED STATES LAWS 
lbi-7729-102255-0027 FOOTNOTE SUMNER TO SHANNON MAY TWELVE EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX 
lbi-7729-102255-0028 PRIVATE PERSONS WHO AT LEAST THE FREE STATE HOTEL VAINLY BESOUGHT THE VARIOUS AUTHORITIES TO PRESENT THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR PROPERTY 
lbi-7729-102255-0029 TEN DAYS WERE CONSUMED IN THESE NEGOTIATIONS BUT THE SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE REFUSED TO YIELD

lbi-7729-102255-0033 AS HE HAD PROMISED TO PROTECT THE HOTEL THE REASSURED CITIZENS BEGAN TO LAUGH AT THEIR OWN FEARS 
lbi-7729-102255-0034 TO THEIR SORROW THEY WERE SOON UNDECEIVED 
lbi-7729-102255-0035 THE MILITARY FORCE PARTLY RABBLE PARTLY ORGANIZED HAD MEANWHILE MOVED INTO THE TOWN 
lbi-7729-102255-0036 HE PLANTED A COMPANY BEFORE THE HOTEL AND DEMANDED A SURRENDER OF THE ARMS BELONGING TO THE FREE STATE MILITARY COMPANIES 
lbi-7729-102255-0037 HALF AN HOUR LATER TURNING A DEAF EAR TO ALL REMONSTRANCE HE GAVE THE PROPRIETORS UNTIL FIVE O'CLOCK TO REMOVE THEIR FAMILIES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY FROM THE FREE STATE HOTEL 
lbi-7729-102255-0038 ATCHISON WHO HAD BEEN HARANGUING THE MOB PLANTED HIS TWO GUNS BEFORE THE BUILDING AND TRAIN THEM UPON IT 
lbi-7729-102255-0039 THE INMATES BEING REMOVED AT THE APPOINTED HOUR A FEW CANNON BALLS WERE FIRED THROUGH THE STONE WALLS 
lbi-7729-102255-0040 IN THIS INCIDENT CONTRASTING THE CREATIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE SPIRIT OF THE FACTIONS THE EMIGRANT AID SOCIETY OF MASSACHUSETTS FINDS ITS MOST HONORABLE AND TRIUMPHANT VINDICATION 
lbi-7729-102255-0041 THE WHOLE PROCEEDING WAS SO CHILDISH THAT MISERABLE PLOT SO TRANSPARENT THE OUTRAGE SO GROSS AS TO BRING DISGUST TO THE BETTER CLASS OF BORDER RUFFIANS WHO WERE WITNESSES AND ACCESSORIES 
lbi-7729-102255-0042 RELOCATED FOOTNOTE GOVERNOR ROBINSON BEING ON HIS WAY EAST THE STEAMBOAT ON WHICH HE WAS TRAVELING STOPPED AT LEXINGTON MISSOURI 
lbi-7729-102255-0043 IN A FEW DAYS AN OFFICER CAME WITH A REQUISITION FROM GOVERNOR SHANNON AND TOOK THE PRISONER BY LAND TO WESTPORT AND AFTERWARDS FROM THERE TO KANSAS CITY AND LEAVENWORTH 
lbi-7729-102255-0044 HARRY WAS PLACED IN THE CUSTODY OF CAPTAIN MARTIN OF THE KICKAPOO RANGERS WHO PROVED A KIND JAILOR AND MATERIALLY ASSISTED IN PROTECTING HIM FROM THE DANGEROUS INTENTIONS OF THE MOB WHICH AT THAT TIME HELD LEAVENWORTH UNDER THE REIGN OF TERROR 
lbi-7729-102255-0045 CAPTAIN MARTIN SAID I SHALL GIVE YOU A PISTOL TO PROTECT YOURSELF IF WORSE COMES TO WORST 
lbi-7729-102255-0046 IN THE EARLY MORNING OF THE NEXT DAY MAY TWENTY NINE A COMPANY OF DRAGOONS WITH ONE EMPTY SADDLE CAME DOWN FROM THE FORT AND WHILE THE PRO SLAVERY MEN STILL SLEPT THE PRISONER AND HIS ESCORT WERE ON THEIR WAY ACROSS THE PRAIRIE TO COMPTON IN THE CHARGE OF OFFICERS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY 
lbi-8224-274381-0000 THOUGH THROWN INTO PRISON FOR THIS ENTERPRISE AND DETAINED SOME TIME HE WAS NOT DISCOURAGED BUT STILL CONTINUED BY HIS COUNTENANCE AND PROTECTION TO INFUSE SPIRIT INTO THE DISTRESSED ROYALISTS 
lbi-8224-274381-0001 AMONG OTHER PERSONS OF DISTINCTION WHO UNITED THEMSELVES TO HIM WAS LORD NAPIER OF MURCHISON SON OF THE FAMOUS INVENTOR OF THE LOGARITHMS THE PERSON TO WHOM THE TITLE OF A GREAT MAN IS MORE JUSTLY DUE THAN TO ANY OTHER WHOM HIS COUNTRY EVER PRODUCED 
lbi-8224-274381-0002 WHILE THE FORMER FORETOLD THAT THE SCOTTISH COVENANTERS WERE SECRETLY FORMING A UNION WITH THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT AND INCULCATED THE NECESSITY OF PREVENTING THEM BY SOME VIGOROUS UNDERTAKING THE LATTER STILL INSISTED THAT EVERY SUCH ATTEMPT WOULD PRECIPITATE THEM INTO MEASURES TO WHICH OTHERWISE THEY WERE NOT PERHAPS INCLINED 
lbi-8224-274381-0003 THE KING'S EARS WERE NOW OPEN TO MONTROSE HIS COUNSELS WHO PROPOSED NONE BUT THE BOLDEST AND MOST DARING AGREEABLY TO THE DESPERATE STATE OF THE ROYAL CAUSE IN SCOTLAND 
lbi-8224-274381-0004 FIVE HUNDRED MEN MORE WHO HAD BEEN LEVIED BY THE COVENANTERS WERE PERSUADED TO EMBRACE THE ROYAL CAUSE AND WITH THIS COMBINED FORCE HE HASTENED TO ATTACK LORD ELKO WHO LAY AT PERTH WITH AN ARMY OF SIX THOUSAND MEN ASSEMBLED UPON THE FIRST NEWS OF THE IRISH INVASION 
lbi-8224-274381-0005 DREADING THE SUPERIOR POWER OF ARGYLE WHO HAVING JOINED HIS VASSALS TO A FORCE LEVIED BY THE PUBLIC WAS APPROACHING WITH A CONSIDERABLE ARMY MONTROSE HASTENED NORTHWARD IN ORDER TO ROUSE AGAIN THE MARQUIS OF HUNTLY AND THE GORDONS WHO HAVING BEFORE HASTILY TAKEN ARMS HAD BEEN INSTANTLY SUPPRESSED BY THE COVENANTERS 
lbi-8224-274381-0006 THIS NOBLEMAN'S CARTER THOUGH CELEBRATED FOR POLITICAL COURAGE AND CONDUCT WAS VERY LOW FOR MILITARY PROWESS AND AFTER SOME SKIRMISHES IN WHICH HE WAS WORSTED HE HERE ALLOWED MONTROSE TO ESCAPE HIM 
lbi-8224-274381-0007 BY QUICK MARCHES THROUGH THESE INACCESSIBLE MOUNTAINS THAT GENERAL FREED HIMSELF FROM THE SUPERIOR FORCES OF THE COVENANTERS 
lbi-8224-274381-0008 WITH THESE AND SOME REINFORCEMENTS OF THE ETHEL MEN AND MC DONALD'S WHOM HE HAD RECALLED MONTROSE FELL SUDDENLY UPON ARGYLE'S COUNTRY AND LET LOOSE UPON IT ALL THE RAGE OF WAR CARRYING OFF THE CATTLE BURNING THE HOUSES AND PUTTING THE INHABITANTS TO THE SWORD 
lbi-8224-274381-0009 THIS SEVERITY BY WHICH MONTROSE SULLIED HIS VICTORIES WAS THE RESULT OF PRIVATE ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE CHIEFTAIN AS MUCH AS OF ZEAL FOR THE PUBLIC CAUSE ARGYLE COLLECTING THREE THOUSAND MEN MARCHED IN QUEST OF THE ENEMY WHO HAD RETIRED WITH THEIR PLUNDER AND HE LAY AT INNER LOCKY SUPPOSING HIMSELF STILL AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THEM 
lbi-8224-274381-0010 BY A QUICK AND UNEXPECTED MARCH MONTROSE HASTENED TO ENTER LOCKY AND PRESENTED HIMSELF IN ORDER OF BATTLE BEFORE THE SURPRISED BUT NOT FRIGHTENED COVENANTERS 
lbi-8224-274381-0011 HIS CONDUCT AND PRESENCE OF MIND IN THIS EMERGENCE APPEARED CONSPICUOUS 
lbi-8224-274381-0012 MONTROSE WEAK IN CAVALRY HERE LINED HIS TROOPS OF HORSE WITH INFANTRY AND AFTER PUTTING THE ENEMY'S HORSE TO ROUT FELL WITH UNITED FORCE UPON THEIR FOOT WHO WERE ENTIRELY CUT IN PIECES THOUGH WITH THE LOSS OF THE GALLANT LORD GORDON ON THE PART OF THE ROYALISTS 
lbi-8224-274381-0013 FROM THE SAME MEN NEW REGIMENTS AND NEW COMPANIES WERE FORMED DIFFERENT OFFICERS APPOINTED AND THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE PUT INTO SUCH HANDS AS THE INDEPENDENTS COULD RELY ON 
lbi-8224-274381-0014 BESIDES MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT WHO WERE EXCLUDED MANY OFFICERS UNWILLING TO SERVE UNDER THE NEW GENERALS THREW UP THEIR COMMISSIONS AND UNWARILY FACILITATED THE PROJECT OF PUTTING THE ARMY ENTIRELY INTO THE HANDS OF THAT FACTION 
lbi-8224-274381-0015 THEY ARE THE DISCIPLINE OF THE FORMER PARLIAMENTARY ARMY WAS NOT CONTEMPTIBLE A MORE EXACT PLAN WAS INTRODUCED AND RIGOROUSLY EXECUTED BY THESE NEW COMMANDERS 
lbi-8224-274381-0016 VALOR INDEED WAS VERY GENERALLY DIFFUSED OVER THE ONE PARTY AS WELL AS THE OTHER DURING THIS PERIOD DISCIPLINE ALSO WAS ATTAINED BY THE FORCES OF THE PARLIAMENT BUT THE PERFECTION OF THE MILITARY ART IN CONCERTING THE GENERAL PLANS OF ACTION AND THE OPERATIONS OF THE FIELD SEEMS STILL ON BOTH SIDES TO HAVE BEEN IN A GREAT MEASURE WANTING 
lbi-8224-274381-0017 HISTORIANS AT LEAST PERHAPS FROM THEIR OWN IGNORANCE AND INEXPERIENCE HAVE NOT REMARKED ANY THING BUT A HEADLONG IMPETUOUS CONDUCT EACH PARTY HURRYING TO A BATTLE WHERE VALOUR AND FORTUNE CHIEFLY DETERMINED THE SUCCESS 
lbi-8224-274384-0000 HE PASSED THROUGH HENLEY SAINT ALBAN'S AND CAME SO NEAR TO LONDON AS HARROW ON THE HILL 
lbi-8224-274384-0001 THE SCOTTISH GENERALS AND COMMISSIONERS AFFECTED GREAT SURPRISE ON THE APPEARANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PAID HIM ONLY EXTERIOR RESPECT DUE TO HIS DIGNITY THEY INSTANTLY SET A GUARD UPON HIM UNDER COLOUR OF PROTECTION AND MADE HIM IN REALITY A PRISONER 
lbi-8224-274384-0002 THEY INFORMED THE ENGLISH PARLIAMENT OF THIS UNEXPECTED INCIDENT AND ASSURED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIVATE TREATY WITH THE KING 
lbi-8224-274384-0003 OR HATH HE GIVEN US ANY GIFT 
lbi-8224-274384-0004 AND THE MEN OF ISRAEL ANSWERED THE MEN OF JUDAH AND SAID WE HAVE TEN PARTS IN THE KING AND WE HAVE ALSO MORE RIGHT IN DAVID THEN YE WHY THEN DID YOU DESPISE US THAT OUR ADVICE SHOULD NOT BE FIRST HAD IN BRINGING BACK OUR KING 
lbi-8224-274384-0005 ANOTHER PREACHER AFTER REPROACHING HIM TO HIS FACE WITH HIS MISGOVERNMENT ORDERED THIS PSALM TO BE SUNG 
lbi-8224-274384-0006 THE KING STOOD UP AND CALLED FOR THAT PSALM WHICH BEGINS WITH THESE WORDS 
lbi-8224-274384-0007 HAVE MERCY LORD ON ME I PRAY FOR MEN WITH ME DEVOUR 
lbi-8224-274384-0008 THE GOOD NATURED AUDIENCE IN PITY TO FALLEN MAJESTY SHOWED FOR ONCE GREATER DEFERENCE TO THE KING THAN TO THE MINISTER AND SUNG THE PSALM WHICH THE FORMER HAD CALLED FOR 
lbi-8224-274384-0009 THE PARLIAMENT AND THE SCOTS LAID THEIR PROPOSALS BEFORE THE KING 
lbi-8224-274384-0010 BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF TERMS THE ADMINISTRATION MUST BE POSSESSED ENTIRELY BY THE PARLIAMENTS OF BOTH KINGDOMS AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE THAT SCHEME WITH THE LIBERTY OF THE KING IS EASILY IMAGINED 
lbi-8224-274384-0011 THE ENGLISH IT IS EVIDENT HAD THEY NOT BEING PREVIOUSLY ASSURED OF RECEIVING THE KING WOULD NEVER HAVE PARTED WITH SO CONSIDERABLE A SUM AND WHILE THEY WEAKEN THEMSELVES BY THE SAME MEASURE HAVE STRENGTHENED TO PEOPLE WITH WHOM THEY MUST AFTERWARDS HAVE SO MATERIAL AN INTEREST TO DISCUSS 
lbi-8224-274384-0012 IF ANY STILL RETAINED RANCOR AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT CONDITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISHERS MORE GENEROUS THAN PRUDENT WHO ACCOMPANIED HIS MARCH WITH TEARS WITH ACCLAMATIONS AND WITH PRAYERS FOR HIS SAFETY 
lbi-8224-274384-0013 HIS DEATH IN THIS CONJUNCTURE WAS A PUBLIC MISFORTUNE 
lbi-8230-279154-0000 THE ANALYSIS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCCUPY US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIRTEENTH LECTURE AND IS THE MOST DIFFICULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTERPRISE 
lbi-8230-279154-0001 WHAT IS CALLED PERCEPTION DIFFERS FROM SENSATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENSATIONAL INGREDIENTS BRING UP HABITUAL ASSOCIATES IMAGES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THEIR USUAL CORRELATES ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECTIVELY INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE SENSATION 
lbi-8230-279154-0002 WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCIPLE IS LIABLE TO EXCEPTIONS EVERY ONE WOULD AGREE THAT IT HAS A BROAD MEASURE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACTLY MIGHT SEEM AN OVERSTATEMENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE CORRECT TO SAY THAT IDA'S APPROXIMATELY REPRESENT IMPRESSIONS 
lbi-8230-279154-0003 AND WHAT SORT OF EVIDENCE IS LOGICALLY POSSIBLE 
lbi-8230-279154-0004 THERE IS NO LOGICAL IMPOSSIBILITY AND THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE WORLD SPRANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACTLY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A POPULATION THAT REMEMBERED A WHOLLY UNREAL PAST 
lbi-8230-279154-0005 ALL THAT I'M DOING IS TO USE ITS LOGICAL INABILITY AS A HELP IN THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT OCCURS WHEN WE REMEMBER 
lbi-8230-279154-0006 THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE TWO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE PSYCHOLOGY A RECORD OF BEHAVIOUR HAS TO TRUST HIS MEMORY AND MAKING THE WRECKER 
lbi-8230-279154-0007 HABIT IS A CONCEPT INVOLVING THE OCCURRENCE OF SIMILAR EVENTS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEHAVIOUR AND FEELS CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PHENOMENON AS HABIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TRUSTS HIS MEMORY WHEN IT ASSURES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES 
lbi-8230-279154-0008 BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INFERENCE IS WARRANTED 
lbi-8230-279154-0009 OUR CONFIDENCE OR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE ACCURACY OF A MEMORY IMAGE MUST AND FUNDAMENTAL CASES BE BASED UPON A CHARACTERISTIC OF THE IMAGE ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EVOKE THE PAST BODILY AND COMPARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAGE 
lbi-8230-279154-0010 WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAGES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PECULIARLY VAGUE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TRUST FOR EXAMPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FATIGUE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND'S FACE VIVIDLY AND CLEARLY BUT HORRIBLY DISTORTED 
lbi-8230-279154-0011 SOME IMAGES LIKE SOME SENSATIONS FILLED VERY FAMILIAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE 
lbi-8230-279154-0012 FAMILIARITY AS IF FEELING CAPABLE OF DEGREES 
lbi-8230-279154-0013 IN AN IMAGE OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAMPLE SOME PARTS MAY FEEL MORE FAMILIAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE MORE BELIEF IN THE ACCURACY OF THE FAMILIAR PARTS THAN IN THAT OF THE UNFAMILIAR PARTS 
lbi-8230-279154-0014 I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MEMORY IMAGES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST 
lbi-8230-279154-0015 THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTERISTIC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REFERRING TO MORE OR LESS REMOTE PORTIONS OF THE PAST 
lbi-8230-279154-0016 IN ACTUAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBTLESS VARIOUS FACTORS THAT CONCUR IN GIVING US THE FILLING OF GREATER OR LESS REMOTENESS AND SOME REMEMBERED EVENT 
lbi-8230-279154-0017 THERE MAY BE A SPECIFIC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FILLING OF PASTON US ESPECIALLY WHERE IMMEDIATE MEMORY IS CONCERNED 
lbi-8230-279154-0018 THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWING THE TEMPORAL RELATION OF OR REMEMBERED EVENT TO THE PRESENT AND KNOWING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBERED EVENTS 
lbi-8230-279154-0019 IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER RECENT EVENTS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACCURATELY BY MEANS OF FEELINGS GIVING THEIR TEMPORAL RELATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELINGS MUST PLAY AN ESSENTIAL PART IN THE PROCESS OF DATING REMEMBERED EVENTS 
lbi-8230-279154-0020 IF WE HAD RETAINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF MEMORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE 
lbi-8230-279154-0021 REMEMBERING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCCURRENCE IN SOMEWAY RESEMBLING OR RELATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBERED 
lbi-8230-279154-0022 SOME POINTS MAY BE TAKEN AS FIXED AND SUCH AS ANY THEORY OF MEMORY MUST ARRIVE AT 
lbi-8230-279154-0023 IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADVANCE IS RATHER VAGUE 
lbi-8230-279154-0024 THE FIRST OF OUR VAGUE BUT INDISPUTABLE DATA IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST 
lbi-8230-279154-0025 WE MIGHT PROVISIONALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE CORRECTLY DEFINE MEMORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOWING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO ANALOGUE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FUTURE SUCH A DEFINITION WOULD AT LEAST SERVE TO MARK THE PROBLEM WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCERNED THOUGH SOME EXPECTATIONS MAY DESERVE TO RANK WITH MEMORY AS REGARDS IMMEDIACY 
lbi-8230-279154-0026 THIS DISTINCTION IS VITAL TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEMORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EASY TO CARRY OUT IN PRACTICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THEORY 
lbi-8230-279154-0027 A GRAMAPHONE BY THE HELP OF SUITABLE RECORDS MIGHT RELATE TO US THE INCIDENTS OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRAMAPHONE DOES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE 
lbi-8230-279154-0028 I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBERED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAKFAST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE HOLY HABIT THAT ENABLES ME TO DO THIS 
lbi-8230-279154-0029 THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN RECITE A POEM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBERS ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS RECITED OR READ IT 
lbi-8230-279154-0030 SIMMONS TO BOOKS MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER LECTURE DID NOT TOUCH KNOWLEDGE MEMORY AT ALL CLOSELY 
lbi-8230-279154-0031 THEY GIVE LAWS ACCORDING TO WHICH IMAGES OF PAST OCCURRENCES COME INTO OUR MINDS BUT DO NOT DISCUSS OUR BELIEF THAT THESE IMAGES REFER TO PAST OCCURRENCES WHICH IS WHAT CONSTITUTES KNOWLEDGE MEMORY 
lbi-8230-279154-0032 IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 
lbi-8230-279154-0033 IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS RELIABLE ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPERIENCED THE WELL KNOWN ILLUSION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPPENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME 
lbi-8230-279154-0034 WHENEVER THE SENSE OF FAMILIARITY OCCURS WITHOUT A DEFINITE OBJECT IT LEAVES US TO SEARCH THE ENVIRONMENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISFIED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPROPRIATE OBJECT WHICH LEADS US TO THE JUDGMENT THIS IS FAMILIAR 
lbi-8230-279154-0035 THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE FEELING OF FAMILIARITY ALONE 
lbi-8230-279154-0036 A FURTHER STAGE IS RECOGNITION 
lbi-8230-279154-0037 RECOGNITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY INVOLVE MORE THAN A HABIT OF ASSOCIATION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN AUDITORY IMAGE OF PURRING OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WE MAY HAPPEN TO RECOGNIZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT 
lbi-8230-279154-0038 WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUDGE WHEN WE RECOGNIZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUDGMENT AS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECOGNITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROBABLY BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ANIMALS THAT NEVERTHELESS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF RECOGNITION AND THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD 
lbi-8230-279154-0039 THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEMORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT 
lbi-8230-279154-0040 THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINTS IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECOGNITION IS INADEQUATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE DIRECT TO DEFINE RECOGNITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THEN AS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE 
lbi-8230-279154-0041 THE DEFINITION OF MY EXPERIENCE IS DIFFICULT BROADLY SPEAKING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CONNECTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPERIENCING NOW BY CERTAIN LINKS OF WHICH THE VARIOUS FORMS OF MEMORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT 
lbi-8230-279154-0042 THUS IF I RECOGNIZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE IN VIRTUE OF WHICH I RECOGNIZE IT FORMS PART OF MY EXPERIENCE BY DEFINITION RECOGNITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MARKS BY WHICH MY EXPERIENCE IS SINGLED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD 
lbi-8230-279154-0043 OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXISTED BEFORE ARE A VERY INADEQUATE TRANSLATION OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE FORM A JUDGMENT OF RECOGNITION BUT THAT IS UNAVOIDABLE WORDS ARE FRAMED TO EXPRESS A LEVEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PRIMITIVE AND ARE QUITE INCAPABLE OF EXPRESSING SUCH AN ELEMENTARY OCCURRENCE AS A RECOGNITION 
lbi-8455-210777-0000 I REMAINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CHAMBERS I HAD GRADUALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT 
lbi-8455-210777-0001 HAD EITHER CRESSWELL OR NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD JACK BEEN STILL AT COLLEGE HAD SIR KENNINGTON OVAL REMAINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BUNNETT AND THE BAR KEEPER NOT SUCCEEDED IN STOPPING MY CARRIAGE ON THE HILL SHALL I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN ARRANGING FOR THE FINAL DEPARTURE OF MY OLD FRIEND 
lbi-8455-210777-0002 ON ARRIVING AT HOME AT MY OWN RESIDENCE I FOUND THAT OUR SALON WAS FILLED WITH A BRILLIANT COMPANY 
lbi-8455-210777-0003 AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRACIOUS BOW AND I THINK I SHOWED HIM BY MY MODE OF ADDRESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GRUDGE AS TO MY INDIVIDUAL SELF 
lbi-8455-210777-0004 I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHORES MISTER PRESIDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PROGRESSING IN THIS DISTANT QUARTER OF THE WORLD 
lbi-8455-210777-0005 WE HAVE OUR LITTLE STRUGGLES HERE AS ELSEWHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WATER 
lbi-8455-210777-0006 WE ARE QUITE SATISFIED NOW CAPTAIN BATTLEAXE SAID MY WIFE 
lbi-8455-210777-0007 QUITE SATISFIED SAID EVA 
lbi-8455-210777-0008 THE LADIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT SOFTNESS OF HEART WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC ARE ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MANAGED OR ON THE OTHER 
lbi-8455-210777-0009 NO DOUBT IN PROCESS OF TIME THE LADIES WILL FOLLOW 
lbi-8455-210777-0010 THERE MASTER SAID MISSUS NEVERBEND 
lbi-8455-210777-0011 I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAXE TOUCH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECTS AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS 
lbi-8455-210777-0012 MISSUS NEVERBEND YOU MUST INDEED BE PROUD OF YOUR SON 
lbi-8455-210777-0013 JACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FAR CORNER OF THE ROOM TALKING TO EVA AND WAS NOW REDUCED TO SILENCE BY HIS PRAISES 
lbi-8455-210777-0014 SIR KENNINGTON OVAL IS A VERY FINE PLAYER SAID MY WIFE 
lbi-8455-210777-0015 I AND MY WIFE AND SON AND THE CHEAP PRESS DWELLERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AGREED TO DINE ON BOARD THE SHIP ON THE NEXT 
lbi-8455-210777-0016 THIS I FELT WAS PAID TO ME AS BEING PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC AND I ENDEAVOURED TO BEHAVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MINGLED HUMILITY AND DIGNITY AS MIGHT BEFIT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANTING TO THE SIMPLICITY OF MY ORDINARY LIFE 
lbi-8455-210777-0017 MY WIFE ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT MANAGED TO GIVE THE GENTLEMAN A VERY GOOD DINNER 
lbi-8455-210777-0018 THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HOSPITALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I DID NOT AGREE WITH HER 
lbi-8455-210777-0019 THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEADING MEN OF THE COMMUNITY WITH THEIR WIVES WHO ARE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS OF THE YOUNG LADIES 
lbi-8455-210777-0020 OH YES SAID JACK AND I'M NOWHERE 
lbi-8455-210777-0021 BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY INNINGS BEFORE LONG 
lbi-8455-210777-0022 OF WHAT MISSUS NEVERBEND HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROVIDING BIRDS BEASTS AND FISHES NOT TO TALK OF TARTS AND JELLIES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT SHE ACCOMPLISHED HER TASK WITH THOROUGH SUCCESS 
lbi-8455-210777-0023 WE SAT WITH THE OFFICER SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT ASHORE 
lbi-8455-210777-0024 HOW MUCH OF EVIL OF REAL ACCOMPLISHED EVIL HAS NOT OCCURRED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS 
lbi-8455-210777-0025 WHAT CAN I DO NOW BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND DIE 
lbi-8455-210777-0026 AND A DEATH OF WHICH I DRANK COULD NOT ALAS 
lbi-8455-210777-0027 WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VESSEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RETIRE TO A SMALL FARM WHICH I POSSESSED AT THE FURTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IN SECLUSION WOULD I END MY DAYS 
lbi-8455-210777-0028 JACK WOULD BECOME EVA'S HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REMAIN AMIDST THE HURRY DUTIES OF THE EAGER WORLD 
lbi-8455-210777-0029 THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP 
lbi-8455-210777-0030 MISTER NEVERBEND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSERVE THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERALLY ADDRESS ME AS PRESIDENT THERE CANNOT BE DENIED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UNPLEASANT MISSION 
lbi-8455-210777-0031 YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THE COURTESY AND HOSPITALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STAND SO HIGH 
lbi-8455-210777-0032 IT IS A DUTY SAID I 
lbi-8455-210777-0033 BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPERIOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADVANCE AS TO MAKE US HEAR FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DISGRACE IN YIELDING TO IT 
lbi-8455-210777-0034 NOT A DOUBT BUT HAD PERFORCE BEEN ONLY DOUBLE OR TREBLE OUR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FELT IT MY DUTY TO STRUGGLE WITH YOU 
lbi-8455-210777-0035 THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVERBEND SAID SIR FERDINAND OH BROWN 
lbi-8455-210777-0036 I CAN AFFORD TO SMILE BECAUSE I AM ABSOLUTELY POWERLESS BEFORE YOU BUT I DO NOT THE LESS FEEL THAT IN A MATTER OF WHICH THE PROGRESS OF THE WORLD IS CONCERNED I OR RATHER WE HAVE BEEN PUT DOWN BY BRUTE FORCE 
lbi-8455-210777-0037 YOU HAVE COME TO US THREATENING US WITH ABSOLUTE DESTRUCTION 
lbi-8455-210777-0038 THEREFORE I FEEL MYSELF QUITE ABLE AS PRESIDENT OF THIS REPUBLIC TO RECEIVE YOU WITH THE COURTESY DUE TO THE SERVANTS OF A FRIENDLY ALLY 
lbi-8455-210777-0039 I CAN ASSURE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE TRIGGER SINCE I HAVE BEEN A BORE 
lbi-8455-210777-0040 THEN SAID SIR FERNANDO THERE'S NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT WE MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM 
lbi-8455-210777-0041 THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHOCK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXCEEDED ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET FELT 
lbi-8455-210777-0042 YOU HEAR WHAT SIR FERDINAND A BROWN A SAD REPLIED CAPTAIN BATTLEAXE 
lbi-8455-210777-0043 BUT WHAT IS A DELICATE MISSION I ASKED 
lbi-8455-210777-0044 I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSEWHERE OR DROWNED UPON THE VOYAGE IT MATTERED NOT WHICH 
lbi-8455-210777-0045 THEN THE REPUBLIC A BRITON ULA WAS TO BE DECLARED AS NON EXISTENT AND THE BRITISH FLAG WAS TO BE EXALTED AND A BRITISH GOVERNOR INSTALLED IN THE EXECUTIVE CHAMBERS 
lbi-8455-210777-0046 YOU MAY BE QUITE SURE IT'S THERE SAID CAPTAIN BATTLEAXE AND THAT I CAN SO USE IT ASKED A HALF OBLITERATE YOUR TOWN WITHIN TWO MINUTES OF MY RETURN ON BOARD 
lbi-8455-210777-0047 YOU PROPOSE TO KIDNAP ME I SAID 
lbi-8455-210777-0048 WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOUR GUN WERE I TO KIDNAP YOU 
lbi-8455-210777-0049 LIEUTENANT CROSSTREES IS A VERY GALLANT OFFICER 
lbi-8455-210777-0050 ONE OF US ALWAYS REMAINS ON BOARD WHILE THE OTHERS ON SHORE 
lbi-8455-210777-0051 WHAT WORLDWIDE INIQUITY SUCH A SPEECH AS THAT DISCLOSES SAID I STILL TURNING MYSELF TO THE CAPTAIN FOR THOUGH I WOULD HAVE CRUSHED THEM BOTH BY MY WORDS HAD IT BEEN POSSIBLE MY DISLIKE CENTRED ITSELF ON SIR FERDINANDO 
lbi-8455-210777-0052 YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SUGGEST SAID HE BUT THAT IS A MATTER OF OPINION 
lbi-8455-210777-0053 WERE I TO COMPLY WITH YOUR ORDERS WITHOUT EXPRESSING MY OWN OPINION I SHALL SEEM TO HAVE DONE SO WILLINGLY HEREAFTER 
lbi-8455-210777-0054 THE LETTER RAN AS FOLLOWS 
lbi-8455-210777-0055 SIR I HAVE IT IN COMMAND TO INFORM YOUR EXCELLENCY THAT YOU HAVE BEEN APPOINTED GOVERNOR OF THE CROWN COLONY WHICH IS CALLED BRITAIN MULA 
lbi-8455-210777-0056 THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COLONY ARE WITHIN YOUR EXCELLENCY'S KNOWLEDGE 
lbi-8455-210777-0057 BUT IN THEIR SELECTION OF A CONSTITUTION THE BRITON EULOGISTS HAVE UNFORTUNATELY ALLOW THEMSELVES BUT ONE DELIBERATE ASSEMBLY AND HENCE HAVE SPRUNG THEIR PRESENT DIFFICULTIES 
lbi-8455-210777-0058 IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ACKNOWLEDGED WEAKNESS OF THOSE WHO SURVIVE THE PERIOD OF LIFE AT WHICH MEN CEASE TO WORK 
lbi-8455-210777-0059 BUT IT IS SURMISED THAT YOU WILL FIND DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF YOUR ENTERING AT ONCE UPON YOUR GOVERNOR 
lbi-8455-210777-0060 THE JOHN BRIGHT IS ARMED WITH A WEAPON OF GREAT POWER AGAINST WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRITAIN ULA SHOULD PREVAIL 
lbi-8455-210777-0061 YOU WILL CARRY OUT WITH YOU ONE HUNDRED MEN OF THE NORTH NORTH WEST BIRMINGHAM REGIMENT WHICH WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE FOR YOUR OWN SECURITY AS IT IS THOUGHT THAT IF MISTER NEVERBEND BE WITHDRAWN THE PEOPLE THE RIVER EASILY TO THEIR OLD HABITS OF OBEDIENCE 
lbi-8455-210777-0062 WHEN DO YOU INTEND THAT THE JOHN BRIGHT SHALL START 
lbi-8455-210777-0063 TODAY I SHOUTED 
lbi-8455-210777-0064 AND I HAVE NO ONE READY TO WHOM I CAN GIVE UP THE ARCHIVES OF THE GOVERNMENT 
lbi-8455-210777-0065 I SHALL BE HAPPY TO TAKE CHARGE OF THEM SAID SIR FERNANDO 
lbi-8455-210777-0066 THEY OF COURSE MUST ALL BE OTTER 
lbi-8455-210777-0067 OR OF THE HABITS OF OUR PEOPLE IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE 
lbi-8455-210777-0068 YOUR POWER IS SUFFICIENT I SAID 
lbi-8455-210777-0069 IF YOU WILL GIVE US YOUR PROMISE TO MEET CAPTAIN AT LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME TO MORROW WE WILL STRETCH A POINT AND DELAY THE DEPARTURE OF THE JOHN BRIGHT FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS 
lbi-8455-210777-0070 AND THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED TO IN ORDER TO EXTRACT FROM ME A PROMISE THAT I WOULD DEPART IN PEACE 
lbi-8463-287645-0000 THIS WAS WHAT DID THE MISCHIEF SO FAR AS THE RUNNING AWAY WAS CONCERNED 
lbi-8463-287645-0001 IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO SAY MORE OF THEM HERE 
lbi-8463-287645-0002 FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF WITH REGARD TO ROBERT HALL AND NO MAN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF HIS RECOLLECTIONS WILL BE LONGER REMEMBERED THAN HE HIS ENTHRALMENT WHILE UNDER HOLLAND WILL HARDLY EVER BE FORGOTTEN 
lbi-8463-287645-0003 OF THIS PARTY EDWARD A BOY OF SEVENTEEN CALLED FORTH MUCH SYMPATHY HE TOO WAS CLAIMED BY HOLLAND 
lbi-8463-287645-0004 JOHN WESLEY CALM BASH JACOB TAYLOR AND THOMAS EDWARD SKINNER

lbi-8463-294828-0000 CHAPTER THREE AS MASTER WISHES 
lbi-8463-294828-0001 THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J B HOBSON'S LETTER I NO MORE DREAMED OF CHASING THE UNICORN THAN OF TRYING FOR THE NORTHWEST PASSAGE 
lbi-8463-294828-0002 EVEN SO I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY EXHAUSTED AND BADLY NEEDING A REST 
lbi-8463-294828-0003 I WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE MY COUNTRY AGAIN MY FRIENDS MY MODEST QUARTERS BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS MY DEARLY BELOVED COLLECTIONS 
lbi-8463-294828-0004 BUT NOW NOTHING COULD HOLD ME BACK 
lbi-8463-294828-0005 CALL SAY WHERE'S MY MANSERVANT 
lbi-8463-294828-0006 FROM RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SCIENTISTS IN OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWO 
lbi-8463-294828-0007 CLASSIFYING WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM SO HE DID NOTHING ELSE WELL VERSED IN THE THEORY OF CLASSIFICATION HE WAS POORLY VERSED IN ITS PRACTICAL APPLICATION AND I DOUBT THAT HE COULD TELL A SPERM WHALE FROM A BUBBLING WAIL 
lbi-8463-294828-0008 AND YET WHAT A FINE GALLANT LAD 
lbi-8463-294828-0009 NOT ONCE DID HE COMMENT ON THE LENGTH OR THE HARDSHIPS OF THE JOURNEY 
lbi-8463-294828-0010 NEVER DID HE OBJECT TO BUCKLING UP HIS SUITCASE FOR ANY COUNTRY WHATEVER CHINA OR THE CONGO NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF IT WAS 
lbi-8463-294828-0011 HE WENT HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE IN PERFECT CONTENTMENT 
lbi-8463-294828-0012 PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THIS UNDERHANDED WAY OF ADMITTING THAT I HAD TURNED FORTY 
lbi-8463-294828-0013 HE WAS A FANATIC ON FORMALITY AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE IT GOT TIRESOME 
lbi-8463-294828-0014 THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO STOP AND THINK EVEN FOR THE WORLD'S MOST EMOTIONLESS MAN 
lbi-8463-294828-0015 CAN SAY I CALLED A THIRD TIME CONCEAL APPEARED 
lbi-8463-294828-0016 DEAD MASTER SUMMONED ME HE SAID ENTERING

lbi-8463-294828-0020 YES WE ARE CERTAINLY I REPLIED EVASIVELY BUT AFTER WE MAKE A DETOUR 
lbi-8463-294828-0021 A ROUTE SLIGHTLY LESS DIRECT THAT'S ALL 
lbi-8463-294828-0022 WE'RE LEAVING ON THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN 
lbi-8463-294828-0023 YOU SEE MY FRIEND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE MONSTER THAT NOTORIOUS NARWHAL 
lbi-8463-294828-0024 WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT WILL TAKE US 
lbi-8463-294828-0025 BUT WE'RE GOING JUST THE SAME 
lbi-8463-294828-0026 WE HAVE A COMMANDER WHOSE GAME FOR ANYTHING 
lbi-8463-294828-0027 I LEFT INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIPPING MY CONTAINERS OF STUFFED ANIMALS AND DRIED PLANTS TO PARIS FRANCE 
lbi-8463-294828-0028 I OPENED A LINE OF CREDIT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE BABIRUSA AND CAN SAY AT MY HEELS I JUMPED INTO A CARRIAGE 
lbi-8463-294828-0029 OUR BAGGAGE WAS IMMEDIATELY CARRIED TO THE DECK OF THE FRIGATE I RUSH TO BOARD 
lbi-8463-294828-0030 I ASKED HER COMMANDER FAGOT 
lbi-8463-294828-0031 ONE OF THE SAILORS LED ME TO THE AFTER DECK WHERE I STOOD IN THE PRESENCE OF A SMART LOOKING OFFICER WHO EXTENDED HIS HAND TO ME 
lbi-8463-294828-0032 IN PERSON WELCOME ABOARD PROFESSOR YOUR CABIN IS WAITING FOR YOU 
lbi-8463-294828-0033 I WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY CABIN WHICH WAS LOCATED IN THE STERN AND OPENED INTO THE OFFICERS MESS 
lbi-8463-294828-0034 WE'LL BE QUITE COMFORTABLE HERE I TOLD GOD SAY 
lbi-8463-294828-0035 AND SO IF I HAD BEEN DELAYED BY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR EVEN LESS THE FRIGATE WOULD HAVE GONE WITHOUT ME AND I WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON DIS AN EARTHLY EXTRAORDINARY AND INCONCEIVABLE EXPEDITION WHOSE TRUE STORY MIGHT WELL MEET WITH SOME SKEPTICISM 
lbi-8463-294828-0036 THE WARS OF BROOKLYN AND EVERY PART OF NEW YORK BORDERING THE EAST RIVER WERE CROWDED WITH CURIOSITY SEEKERS 
lbi-8463-294828-0037 DEPARTING FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THROATS THREE CHEERS BURST FORTH IN SUCCESSION 
lbi-8463-294828-0038 THOUSANDS OF HANDKERCHIEFS WERE WAVING ABOVE THESE TIGHTLY PACKED MASSES HAILING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN UNTIL IT REACHED THE WATERS OF THE HUDSON RIVER AT THE TIP OF THE LONG PENINSULA THAT FORMS NEW YORK CITY 
lbi-8555-284447-0000 THEN HE RUSHED DOWNSTAIRS INTO THE COURTYARD SHOUTING LOUDLY FOR HIS SOLDIERS AND THREATENING TO PITCH EVERY MAN IN HIS DOMINIONS AT THE SAILORMAN WAS NOT RECAPTURED 
lbi-8555-284447-0001 HOLD HIM FAST MY MEN AND AS SOON AS I'VE HAD MY COFFEE AND OATMEAL I'LL TAKE HIM TO THE ROOM OF A GREAT KNIFE AND PATCH HIM 
lbi-8555-284447-0002 I WOULDN'T MIND A CUP OF COFFEE MYSELF SAID KENDALL I HAVE HAD CONSIDERABLE EXERCISE THIS MORNIN AND I'M ALREADY FOR BREAKFAS 
lbi-8555-284447-0003 BUT CAP'N BILL MADE NO SUCH ATTEMPT KNOWING IT WOULD BE USELESS 
lbi-8555-284447-0004 AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE ROOM OF THE GREAT KNIFE THE BULL GAVE A YELL OF DISAPPOINTMENT 
lbi-8555-284447-0005 THE RIM OF THE GREAT KNIFE WAS HIGH AND BIG AND AROUND IT RAN ROWS OF BENCHES FOR THE SPECTATORS TO SIT UPON 
lbi-8555-284447-0006 IN ONE PLACE AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM WAS A RAISED PLATFORM FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY WITH ELEGANT THRONE CHAIRS FOR THE KING AND QUEEN AND SIX SMALLER BUT RICHLY UPHOLSTERED CHAIRS WITH A SNUB NOSE PRINCESSES 
lbi-8555-284447-0007 THEREFORE HER MAJESTY PAID NO ATTENTION TO ANYONE AND NO ONE PAID ANY ATTENTION TO HER 
lbi-8555-284447-0008 RICH JEWELS OF BLUE STONES GLITTERED UPON THEIR PERSONS AND THE ROYAL LADIES WERE FULLY AS GORGEOUS AS THE WERE HAUGHTY AND OVERBEARING 
lbi-8555-284447-0009 MARNING GIRL SOAPY VILLAS WHERE LAZY LOOK 
lbi-8555-284447-0010 CONTROL YOURSELVES MY DEARS REPLIED THE VILLAGE THROUGH THE WORST PUNISHMENT I KNEW HOW TO INFLICT ON ANY ONE THIS PRISONER IS ABOUT TO SUFFER YOU WILL SEE A VERY PRETTY PATCHING MY ROYAL DAUGHTERS 
lbi-8555-284447-0011 SUPPOSE IT'S A FRIEND 
lbi-8555-284447-0012 THE CAPTAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD 
lbi-8555-284447-0013 WHY USE IT TO FETCH THE FIRST LIVING CREATURE WE MET AND THAT WAS THIS BIG GOAT REPLIED THE CAPTAIN PANTING HARD AS HE HELD FAST TO ONE OF THE GOAT'S HORNS 
lbi-8555-284447-0014 THE IDEA OF CATCHING CAMPBELL TO A GOAT WAS VASTLY AMUSING TO HIM AND THE MORE HE THOUGHT OF IT THE MORE HE ROARED WITH LAUGHTER 
lbi-8555-284447-0015 THEY LOOK SOMETHING ALIKE YOU KNOW SUGGESTED THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS LOOKING FROM ONE TO THE OTHER DOUBTFULLY AND THEN NEARLY THE SAME SIZE OF HIS DEN ABOUT ON HIS HIND LEGS THEY'VE BOTH GOT THE SAME STYLE OF WHISKERS AND THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH THEM OBSTINATE AND DANGEROUS SO THEY OUGHT TO MAKE A GOOD PATCH SPLENDID 
lbi-8555-284447-0016 FINE CLOTH ARIAS 
lbi-8555-284447-0017 WHEN THIS HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED THE BULLER LEANED OVER TO TRY TO DISCOVER WHY THE FRAME ROLLED AWAY SEEMINGLY OF ITS OWN ACCORD AND HE WAS THE MORE PUZZLED BECAUSE IT HAD NEVER DONE SUCH A THING BEFORE 
lbi-8555-284447-0018 AT ONCE THE GOAT GAVE A LEAP ESCAPE FROM THE SOLDIERS AND WITH BOWED HEAD RUSHED UPON THE BOAT'S CREW 
lbi-8555-284447-0019 BEFORE ANY COULD STOP HIM HE BUTTED HIS MAJESTY SO FURIOUSLY THAT THE KING'S SWORD FAR INTO THE AIR AND TUMBLED IN A HEAP AMONG THE BENCHES WHERE HE LAY MOANING AND GROANING 
lbi-8555-284447-0020 THE GOATS WARLIKE SPIRIT WAS ROUSED BY THE SUCCESSFUL ATTACK 
lbi-8555-284447-0021 THEN THEY SPED IN GREAT HASTE FOR THE DOOR AND THE GIRL GAVE A FINAL BUT THIS IN THE ROW OF ROYAL LADIES ARE DIVING INTO THE CORRIDOR AND ANOTHER TANGLE WHEREUPON THEY SHRIEKED IN A MANNER THAT TERRIFIED EVERY ONE WITHIN SOUND OF THEIR VOICES 
lbi-8555-284447-0022 I HAD A NOTION IT WAS YOU MADE TO SAVE ME FROM THE KNIFE 
lbi-8555-284447-0023 I DIDN'T SAY MUCH BEING BOUND SO TIGHT BUT WHEN I LOSE I MEAN TO HAVE JUST ONE GOOD SHIVER TO RELIEVE MY FEELIN'S 
lbi-8555-284447-0024 COMING THAT THE BULL A ROW SHE SAID GOING TOWARD THE BENCHES 
lbi-8555-284449-0000 SO THEY WERE QUITE WILLING TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF THEIR GIRL QUEEN AND IN A SHORT TIME THE BLAST OF TRUMPETS AND ROLL OF DRUMS AND CLASHING OF CYMBALS TOLD TROT AND CAP'N BILL THAT THE BLUE BANDS HAD ASSEMBLED BEFORE THE PALACE 
lbi-8555-284449-0001 THEN THEY ALL MARCHED OUT A LITTLE WAY INTO THE FIELDS AND FOUND THAT THE ARMY OF TANKS HAD ALREADY FORMED AND WAS ADVANCING STEADILY TOWARDS THEM 
lbi-8555-284449-0002 AT THE HEAD OF THE YANKEES WERE GET GUZZLE AND BUTTON BRIGHT WHO HAD THE PARROT ON HIS SHOULDER AND THERE WERE SUPPORTED BY CAPTAIN CORALIE AND CAPTAIN INTENT AND ROSALIE THE WITCH 
lbi-8555-284449-0003 WHEN THE BLUE SKY AND SAW GET KISSES ALL THEY RAISED ANOTHER GREAT SHOUT FOR HE WAS THE FAVORITE OF THE SOLDIERS AND VERY POPULAR WITH ALL THE PEOPLE 
lbi-8555-284449-0004 SINCE LAST THURSDAY I KIP GUESSES ALL HAVE BEEN THE LAWFUL RULER OF THE BLUE COUNTRY BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE CONQUERED BY QUEEN SHOT I SUPPOSE I AM CONQUERED TOO AND YOU HAVE NO BOOTS AT ALL 
lbi-8555-284449-0005 WHEN HE FINISHED SHE SAID CHEERFULLY 
lbi-8555-284449-0006 DON'T WORRY SAYS OH DEAR IT'LL ALL COME RIGHT VERY SOON 
lbi-8555-284449-0007 NOW THEN LET'S ENTER THE CITY AND ENJOY THE GREAT FEAST ITS BEING COOKED ON NEARLY STARVED MYSELF FOR THIS CONQUERING KINGDOMS IS HARD WORK 
lbi-8555-284449-0008 THEN SHE GAVE ROSALIE BACK HER MAGIC RING THANKING THE KIND WHICH FOR ALL SHE HAD DONE FOR THEM 
lbi-8555-284449-0009 YOU ARE MATE REPLIED THE SAILOR 
lbi-8555-284449-0010 IT WILL BE SUCH A SATISFACTION 
lbi-8555-284449-0011 THE GUARDS HAD A TERRIBLE STRUGGLE WITH THE GOAT WHICH WAS LOOSE IN THE ROOM AND STILL WANTED TO FIGHT BUT FINALLY THEY SUBDUED THE ANIMAL AND THEN THEY TOOK THE BOAT DREW OUT OF THE FRAME WHOSE TIDE IN AND BROUGHT BOTH HIM AND THE GOAT BEFORE QUEEN TROT WHO AWAITED THEM IN THE THRONE ROOM OF THE PALACE 
lbi-8555-284449-0012 I'LL GLADLY DO THAT PROMISED A NEW BROOM AND I'LL FEED THE HONORABLE GAUDAMA THE SHAVINGS AND LEATHER AND TIN CANS HE CAN EAT BUT SIZE THE GRASS 
lbi-8555-284449-0013 EXCUSE ME SAID SHOT I NEGLECTED TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE NOT THE BOOLA RUE ANYMORE 
lbi-8555-284449-0014 THE FORMER BELONGED GROANED 
lbi-8555-284449-0015 I'LL NOT BE WICKED ANY MORE SIGHED THE OLD MOON I'LL REFORM 
lbi-8555-284449-0016 AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN I SHALL BE A MODEL OF DEPORTMENT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE DANGEROUS TO BE OTHERWISE 
lbi-8555-284449-0017 WHEN FIRST THEY ENTERED THE THRONE ROOM THEY TRIED TO BE AS HAUGHTY AND SCORNFUL AS EVER BUT THE BLUES WHO WERE ASSEMBLED THERE ALL LAUGHED AT THEM AND JEERED THEM FOR THERE IS NOT A SINGLE PERSON IN ALL THE BLUE COUNTRY HE LOVED THE PRINCESS AS THE LEAST LITTLE BIT 
lbi-8555-284449-0018 SO GET KISSES OR ORDERED THE CAPTAIN TO TAKE A FILE OF SOLDIERS AND ESCORT THE RAVING BEAUTIES TO THEIR NEW HOME 
lbi-8555-284449-0019 THAT EVENING TROT GAVE A GRAND BALL IN THE PALACE TO WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THE PIGMIES IN THE BLUESKINS WERE INVITED 
lbi-8555-284449-0020 THE COMBINED BANDS OF BOTH COUNTRIES PLAYED THE MUSIC AND A FINE SUPPER WAS SERVED 
lbi-8555-292519-0000 BRIGHTER THAN EARLY DAWNS MOST BRILLIANT DYE ARE BLOWN CLEAR BANDS OF COLOUR THROUGH THE SKY THE SWIRL AND SWEEP AND MEET TO BREAK AND FOAM LIKE RAINBOW VEILS UPON A BUBBLE OF STONE 
lbi-8555-292519-0001 GUIDED BY YOU HOW WE MIGHT STROLL TOWARDS DEATH OUR ONLY MUSIC ONE ANOTHER'S BREATH THROUGH GARDENS INTIMATE WITH HOLLYHOCKS WHERE'S SILENT POPPIES BURNED BETWEEN THE ROCKS BY POOLS WHERE BIRCHES BEND TO CONFIDENCE ABOVE GREEN WATERS SCUMMED WITH LILY PLANS 
lbi-8555-292519-0002 VENICE 
lbi-8555-292519-0003 AND A SUNSET GLOWING OF CRIMSON AND GOLD SHE LIES THE GLORY OF THE WORLD A BEACHED KING'S GALLEY WHOSE SAILS ARE FURLED HE WAS HUNG WITH TAPESTRIES RICH AND OLD 
lbi-8555-292519-0004 THE PITY THAT WE MUST COME AND GO 
lbi-8555-292519-0005 WHILE THE OLD GOLD AND THE MARVELLOUS DAYS FOR EVER GLEAMING ITS SOFT STRONG BLAZE CALM IN THE EARLY EVENING GLOW 
lbi-8555-292519-0006 THE PLEASANT GRAVEYARD OF MY SOUL WITH SENTIMENTAL CYPRESS TREES AND FLOWERS IS FILLED THAT I'M A STROLL AND MEDITATION AT MY EASE 
lbi-8555-292519-0007 IT IS MY HEART HUNG IN THE SKY AND NO CLOUDS EVER FLOAT BETWEEN THE GRAVE FLOWERS AND MY HEART ON HIGH 
lbi-8555-292519-0008 OVER THE TRACK LINED CITY STREET THE YOUNG MAN THE GRINNING MEN PASS 
lbi-8555-292519-0009 HO YOU SAILS THAT SEEMED TO WONDER AND DREAM FILLED MEADOWS SAY IS THIS SHORE WHERE I STAND THE ONLY FIELD OF STRUGGLE OR ARE YE HIT AND BATTERED OUT THERE BY WAVES AND WIND GUSTS AS HE TEK OVER A CLASHING SEA OF WATERY ECHOES 
lbi-8555-292519-0010 OLD DANCES ARE SIMPLIFIED THEIR YEARNING BLEACHED BY TIME 
lbi-8555-292519-0011 HE HAD GOT INTO HER COURTYARD 
lbi-8555-292519-0012 THROUGH THE BLACK NIGHT RAIN HE SANG TO HER WINDOW BARS 
lbi-8555-292519-0013 THAT WAS BUT RUSTLING OF TRIPPING PLANTS IN THE DARK 
lbi-8555-292519-0014 SHE WAS ALONE THAT NIGHT 
lbi-8555-292519-0015 HE HAD BROKEN INTO HER COURTYARD 
lbi-1221-135766-0000 HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCHED THE GROWTH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BRILLIANT AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT THROUGH ITS QUIVERING SUNSHINE OVER THE TINY FEATURES OF THIS CHILD 
lbi-1221-135766-0001 GOD AS A DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF THE SIN WHICH MAN THUS PUNISHED HAD GIVEN HER A LOVELY CHILD WHOSE PLACE WAS ON THAT SAME DISHONORED BOSOM TO CONNECT HER PARROT FOREVER WITH THE RACE AND DESCENT OF MORTALS AND TO BE FINALLY A BLESSED SOUL IN HEAVEN 
lbi-1221-135766-0002 YET THESE THOUGHTS AFFECTED HESTER PRYNNE LESS WITH HOPE THAN APPREHENSION 
lbi-1221-135766-0003 THE CHILD HAD A NATIVE GRACE WHICH DOES NOT INVARIABLY COEXIST WITH FAULTLESS BEAUTY ITS ATTIRE HOWEVER SIMPLE ALWAYS IMPRESSED THE BEHOLDER AS IF IT WERE THE VERY GARB THAT PRECISELY BECAME AT BEST 
lbi-1221-135766-0004 THIS OUTWARD MUTABILITY INDICATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIRLY EXPRESS THE VARIOUS PROPERTIES OF HER INNER LIFE 
lbi-1221-135766-0005 HESTER COULD ONLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHILD'S CHARACTER AND EVEN THEN MOST VAGUELY AND IMPERFECTLY BY RECALLING WHAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN DURING THAT MOMENTOUS PERIOD WHILE PEARL WAS IMBIBING HER SOUL FROM THE SPIRITUAL WORLD AND HER BODILY FRAME FROM ITS MATERIAL OF EARTH 
lbi-1221-135766-0006 THEY WERE NOW ILLUMINATED BY THE MORNING RADIANCE OF A YOUNG CHILD'S DISPOSITION BUT LATER IN THE DAY OF EARTHLY EXISTENCE MIGHT BE PROLIFIC OF THE STORM AND WHIRLWIND 
lbi-1221-135766-0007 HESTER PRYNNE NEVERTHELESS THE LOVING MOTHER OF THIS ONE CHILD RAN LITTLE RISK OF ERRING ON THE SIDE OF UNDUE SEVERITY 
lbi-1221-135766-0008 MINDFUL HOWEVER OF HER OWN ERRORS AND MISFORTUNES SHE EARLY SOUGHT TO IMPOSE A TENDER BUT STRICT CONTROL OVER THE INFANT IMMORTALITY THAT WAS COMMITTED TO HER CHARGE 
lbi-1221-135766-0009 AS TO ANY OTHER KIND OF DISCIPLINE WHETHER ADDRESSED TO HER MIND OR HEART LITTLE PEARL MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT BE WITHIN ITS REACH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CAPRICE THAT RULED THE MOMENT 
lbi-1221-135766-0010 IT WAS A LOOK SO INTELLIGENT YET INEXPLICABLE PERVERSE SOMETIMES SO MALICIOUS BUT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A WILD FLOW OF SPIRITS BUT HESTER COULD NOT HELP QUESTIONING AT SUCH MOMENTS WHETHER PEARL WAS A HUMAN CHILD 
lbi-1221-135766-0011 BEHOLDING IT HESTER WAS CONSTRAINED TO RUSH TOWARDS THE CHILD TO PURSUE THE LITTLE ELF IN THE FLIGHT WHICH SHE INVARIABLY BEGAN TO SNATCH HER TO HER BOSOM WITH A CLOSE PRESSURE AND EARNEST KISSES NOT SO MUCH FROM OVERFLOWING LOVE AS TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT PEARL WAS FLESH AND BLOOD AND NOT UTTERLY DELUSIVE 
lbi-1221-135766-0012 BROODING OVER ALL THESE MATTERS THE MOTHER FELT LIKE ONE WHO HAS EVOKED SPIRIT BUT BY SOME IRREGULARITY IN THE PROCESS OF CONJURATION HAS FAILED TO WIN THE MASTER WORD THAT SHOULD CONTROL THIS NEW AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE INTELLIGENCE 
lbi-1221-135766-0013 PEARL WAS A BORN OUTCAST OF THE INFANTILE WORLD 
lbi-1221-135766-0014 PEARL SAW AND GAZED INTENTLY BUT NEVER SOUGHT TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE 
lbi-1221-135766-0015 IF SPOKEN TO SHE WOULD NOT SPEAK AGAIN 
lbi-1221-135767-0000 HESTER PRYNNE WENT ONE DAY TO THE MANSION OF GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM WITH A PAIR OF GLOVES WHICH SHE HAD FRINGED AND EMBROIDERED TO HIS ORDER AND WHICH WERE TO BE WORN ON SOME GREAT OCCASION OF STATE FOR THOUGH THE CHANCES OF A POPULAR ELECTION HAD CAUSED THIS FORMER RULER TO DESCEND A STEP OR TWO FROM THE HIGHEST RANK HE STILL HELD AN HONORABLE AND INFLUENTIAL PLACE AMONG THE COLONIAL MAGISTRACY 
lbi-1221-135767-0001 ANOTHER AND FAR MORE IMPORTANT REASON THAN THE DELIVERY OF A PAIR OF EMBROIDERED GLOVES IMPELLED HESTER AT THIS TIME TO SEEK AN INTERVIEW WITH A PERSONAGE OF SO MUCH POWER AND ACTIVITY IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE SETTLEMENT 
lbi-1221-135767-0002 AT THAT EPOCH OF PRISTINE SIMPLICITY HOWEVER MATTERS OF EVEN SLIGHTER PUBLIC INTEREST AND OF FAR LESS INTRINSIC WEIGHT THAN THE WELFARE OF ESTHER AND HER CHILD WERE STRANGELY MIXED UP WITH THE DELIBERATIONS OF LEGISLATORS AND ACTS OF STATE 
lbi-1221-135767-0003 THE PERIOD WAS HARDLY IF AT ALL EARLIER THAN THAT OF OUR STORY WHEN A DISPUTE CONCERNING THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A PIG NOT ONLY CAUSED A FIERCE AND BITTER CONTEST IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OF THE COLONY BUT RESULTED IN AN IMPORTANT MODIFICATION OF THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF OF THE LEGISLATURE 
lbi-1221-135767-0004 WE HAVE SPOKEN OF PEARLS RICH AND LUXURIANT BEAUTY A BEAUTY THAT SHONE WITH DEEP AND VIVID TINTS A BRIGHT COMPLEXION EYES POSSESSING INTENSITY BOTH OF DEPTH AND GLOW AND HAIR ALREADY OF A DEEP GLOSSY BROWN AND WHICH IN AFTER YEARS WOULD BE NEARLY AKIN TO BLACK 
lbi-1221-135767-0005 IT WAS THE SCARLET LETTER IN ANOTHER FORM THE SCARLET LETTER ENDOWED WITH LIFE 
lbi-1221-135767-0006 THE MOTHER HERSELF AS IF THE RED IGNOMINY WERE SO DEEPLY SCORCHED INTO HER BRAIN THAT ALL HER CONCEPTIONS ASSUMED ITS FORM HAD CAREFULLY WROUGHT OUT THE SIMILITUDE LAVISHING MANY HOURS OF MORBID INGENUITY TO CREATE AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE OBJECT OF HER AFFECTION AND THE EMBLEM OF HER GUILT AND TORTURE 
lbi-1221-135767-0007 BUT IN TRUTH PEARL WAS THE ONE AS WELL AS THE OTHER AND ONLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IDENTITY HAD HESTER CONTRIVE SO PERFECTLY TO REPRESENT THE SCARLET LETTER IN HER APPEARANCE 
lbi-1221-135767-0008 COME THEREFORE AND LET US FLING MUD AT THEM 
lbi-1221-135767-0009 BUT PEARL WHO WAS A DAUNTLESS CHILD AFTER FROWNING STAMPING HER FOOT AND SHAKING HER LITTLE HAND WITH A VARIETY OF THREATENING GESTURES SUDDENLY MADE A RUSH AT THE NOD OF HER ENEMIES AND PUT THEM ALL TO FLIGHT 
lbi-1221-135767-0010 SHE SCREAMED AND SHOUTED TOO WITH A TERRIFIC VOLUME OF SOUND WHICH DOUBTLESS CAUSED THE HEARTS OF THE FUGITIVES TO QUAKE WITHIN THEM 
lbi-1221-135767-0011 IT WAS FURTHER DECORATED WITH STRANGE AND SEEMINGLY CABALISTIC FIGURES AND DIAGRAMS SUITABLE TO THE QUAINT TASTE OF THE AGE WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN IN THE STUCCO WHEN NEWLY LAID ON AND HAD NOW GROWN HARD AND DURABLE FOR THE ADMIRATION OF AFTER TIMES 
lbi-1221-135767-0012 THEY APPROACHED THE DOOR WHICH WAS OF AN ARCHED FORM AND FLANKED ON EACH SIDE BY A NARROW TOWER OR PROJECTION OF THE EDIFICE IN BOTH OF WHICH WERE LATTICED WINDOWS THE WOODEN SHUTTERS TO CLOSE OVER THEM AT NEED 
lbi-1221-135767-0013 LIFTING THE IRON HAMMER THAT HUNG AT THE PORTAL HESTER PRYNNE GAVE A SUMMONS WHICH WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BOND SERVANTS A FREE BORN ENGLISHMAN BUT NOW A SEVEN YEARS SLAVE 
lbi-1221-135767-0014 YEA HIS HONORABLE WORSHIP IS WITHIN BUT HE HATH A GODLY MINISTER OR TWO WITH HIM AND LIKEWISE A LEECH 
lbi-1221-135767-0015 YOU MAY NOT SEE HIS WORSHIP NOW 
lbi-1221-135767-0016 WITH MANY VARIATIONS SUGGESTED BY THE NATURE OF HIS BUILDING MATERIALS DIVERSITY OF CLIMATE AND A DIFFERENT MODE OF SOCIAL LIFE GOVERNOR BELLINGHAM HAD PLANNED HIS NEW HABITATION AFTER THE RESIDENCES OF GENTLEMEN OF FAIR ESTATE IN HIS NATIVE LAND 
lbi-1221-135767-0017 ON THE TABLE IN TOKEN THAT THE SENTIMENT OF OLD ENGLISH HOSPITALITY HAD NOT BEEN LEFT BEHIND STOOD A LARGE PEWTER TANKARD AT THE BOTTOM OF WHICH HAD HESTER OR PEARL PEEPED INTO IT THEY MIGHT HAVE SEEMED A FROTHY REMNANT OF A RECENT DRAUGHT OF ALE 
lbi-1221-135767-0018 LITTLE PEARL WHO WAS AS GREATLY PLEASED WITH THE GLEAMING ARMOUR AS SHE HAD BEEN WITH THE GLITTERING FRONT US PEACE OF THE HOUSE SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING INTO THE POLISHED MIRROR OF THE BREASTPLATE 
lbi-1221-135767-0019 MOTHER CRIED SHE I SEE YOU HERE LOOK LOOK 
lbi-1221-135767-0020 IN TRUTH SHE SEEMED ABSOLUTELY HIDDEN BEHIND IT 
lbi-1221-135767-0021 PEARL ACCORDINGLY RAN TO THE BOW WINDOW AT THE FURTHER END OF THE HALL AND LOOKED ALONG THE VISTA OF A GARDEN WALK CARPETED WITH CLOSELY SHAVEN GRASS AND BORDERED WITH SOME RUDE AN AMATEUR ATTEMPT AT SHRUBBERY 
lbi-1221-135767-0022 BUT THE PROPRIETOR APPEARED ALREADY TO HAVE RELINQUISHED AS HOPELESS THE EFFORT TO PERPETUATE ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC IN A HARD SOIL AND AMID THE CLOSE STRUGGLE FOR SUBSISTENCE THE NATIVE ENGLISH TASTE FOR ORNAMENTAL GARDENING 
lbi-1221-135767-0023 THERE WERE A FEW ROSE BUSHES HOWEVER AND A NUMBER OF APPLE TREES PROBABLY THE DESCENDANTS OF THOSE PLANTED BY THE REVEREND MISTER BLACKSTONE THE FIRST SETTLER OF THE PENINSULA THAT HALF MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGE WHO RIDES THROUGH OUR EARLY ANNALS SEATED ON THE BACK OF A BULL 
lbi-1221-135767-0024 PEARL SEEING THE ROSE BUSHES BEGAN TO CRY FOR A RED ROSE AND WOULD NOT BE PACIFIED

lbi-908-31957-0003 WHEN CALLED BEFORE I TOLD HOW HASTILY I DROPPED MY FLOWERS OR BREAK OFF FROM A GAME

lbi-908-31957-0009 AND THOUGH I HAVE GROWN SERENE AND STRONG SINCE THEN I THINK THAT GOD HAS WILLED A STILL RENEWABLE FEAR 
lbi-908-31957-0010 O LOVE O TROTH 
lbi-908-31957-0011 AND LOVE BE FALSE 
lbi-908-31957-0012 IF HE TO KEEP ONE OATH MUST LOSE ONE JOY WHY HIS LIFE'S STAR FORETOLD

lbi-908-31957-0014 A RING OF AMETHYST I COULD NOT WEAR HERE PLAINER TO MY SIGHT THAN THAT FIRST KISS

lbi-1284-1180-0000 HE WORE BLUE SILK STOCKINGS BLUE KNEE PANS WITH GOLD BUCKLES A BLUE RUFFLED WAIST AND A JACKET OF BRIGHT BLUE BRAIDED WITH GOLD 
lbi-1284-1180-0001 HIS HAT HAD A PEAKED CROWN AT A FLAT BRIM AND AROUND THE ROOM WAS A ROW OF TINY GOLDEN BELLS THAT TINKLED WHEN HE MOVED 
lbi-1284-1180-0002 INSTEAD OF SHOES THE OLD MAN WORE BOOTS WITH TURNOVER TOPS AND HIS BLUE COAT HAD WIDE CUFFS OF GOLD BRAID 
lbi-1284-1180-0003 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD WISHED TO EXPLORE THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF OZ IN WHICH THEY LIVED 
lbi-1284-1180-0004 WHEN THEY WERE OUTSIDE UNG SIMPLY LATCHED THE DOOR AND STARTED UP THE PATH 
lbi-1284-1180-0005 NO ONE WOULD DISTURB THEIR LITTLE HOUSE EVEN IF ANYONE CAME SO FAR INTO THE THICK FOREST WHILE THEY WERE GONE 
lbi-1284-1180-0006 AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THAT SEPARATED THE COUNTRY OF THE MUNCHKINS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS THE PATH DIVIDED 
lbi-1284-1180-0007 HE KNEW IT WOULD TAKE THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE CROOKED MAGICIAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN BUT WHO WAS THEIR NEAREST NEIGHBOUR 
lbi-1284-1180-0008 ALL THE MORNING THEY TRUDGED UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND AT NOON UNCLE JOE SAT ON A FALLEN TREE TRUNK AND ATE THE LAST OF THE BREAD WHICH THE OLD MUNCHKIN HAD PLACED IN HIS POCKET 
lbi-1284-1180-0009 THEN THEY STARTED ON AGAIN AND TWO HOURS LATER CAME IN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE OF DOCTOR PIPPED 
lbi-1284-1180-0010 UNCLE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE AND A CHUBBY PLEASANT FACED WOMAN DRESSED ALL IN BLUE OPENED IT AND GREETED THE VISITORS WITH A SMILE 
lbi-1284-1180-0011 I AM MY DEAR AND ALL STRANGERS ARE WELCOME TO MY HOME 
lbi-1284-1180-0012 WE HAVE COME FROM AFAR A LONELIER PLACE THAN THIS A LONELIER PLACE 
lbi-1284-1180-0013 AND YOU MUST BE OLD JOE THE UNLUCKY SHE ADDED 
lbi-1284-1180-0014 ODO HAD NEVER EATEN SUCH A FINE MEAL IN ALL HIS LIFE 
lbi-1284-1180-0015 WE'RE TRAVELLING REPLIED OH JOE AND THE STAFF AT YOUR HOUSE JUST TO REST AND REFRESH OURSELVES 
lbi-1284-1180-0016 THE WOMAN SEEMED THOUGHTFUL 
lbi-1284-1180-0017 AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR CANDLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE 
lbi-1284-1180-0018 IT TAKES ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAGIC POWDER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASED TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I'M MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MARGOT LOT WHO WANTS TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN 
lbi-1284-1180-0019 YOU MUST KNOW SAID MARK A LOT WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEATED TOGETHER ON THE BROAD WINDOW SEAT THAT MY HUSBAND FOOLISHLY GAVE AWAY ALL THE POWDER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MAN BE THE WITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GILLIKINS TO THE NORTH OF HERE 
lbi-1284-1180-0020 THE FIRST LOT WE TESTED ON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE 
lbi-1284-1180-0021 I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAP'N MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND MAY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US 
lbi-1284-1180-0022 I'M AFRAID I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND LIES 
lbi-1284-1180-0023 YOU SEE I'VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITHOUT NUNKY THE SILENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING 
lbi-1284-1180-0024 THAT IS ONE REASON NEW OR OLD JOE THE UNLUCKY SAID THE WOMAN IN A SYMPATHETIC TONE 
lbi-1284-1180-0025 I THINK I MUST SHOW YOU MY PATCHWORK GIRL SAID MARK ALLOT LAUGHING AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT FOR SHE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN 
lbi-1284-1180-0026 BUT FIRST I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE LONGED FOR A SERVANT TO HELP ME WITH THE HOUSEWORK AND TO COOK THE MEALS AND WASH THE DISHES 
lbi-1284-1180-0027 YET THE TASK WAS NOT SO EASY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE 
lbi-1284-1180-0028 A BED QUILT MADE OF PATCHES OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND COLOURS OF CLOTH ALL NEATLY SEWED TOGETHER 
lbi-1284-1180-0029 SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRAZY QUILT BECAUSE THE PATCHES AND COLORS ARE SO MIXED UP 
lbi-1284-1180-0030 WHEN I FOUND IT I SAID TO MYSELF THAT IT WOULD DO NICELY FOR MY SERVANT GIRL FOR WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT TO LIVE SHE WOULD NOT BE PROUD OR HAUGHTY AS THE GLASS CAT IS FOR SUCH A DREADFUL MIXTURE OF COLOURS WOULD DISCOURAGE HER FROM TRYING TO BE AS DIGNIFIED AS THE BLUE MUNCHKIN CZAR 
lbi-1284-1180-0031 AT THE EMERALD CITY WHERE OUR PRINCESS OZMA'S OLIVES GREEN IS THE POPULAR COLOUR 
lbi-1284-1180-0032 I WILL SHOW YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB I DID AND SHE WENT TO A TALL CUPBOARD AND THREW OPEN THE DOORS 
lbi-1284-1181-0000 OH JOE EXAMINED THIS CURIOUS CONTRIVANCE WITH WONDER 
lbi-1284-1181-0001 MARKELOV HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL'S FORM FROM THE PATCHWORK QUILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESSED IT WITH A PATCHWORK SKIRT AND AN APRON WITH POCKETS IN IT USING THE SAME GAME MATERIAL THREW OUT 
lbi-1284-1181-0002 THE HEAD OF THE PATCHWORK GIRL WAS THE MOST CURIOUS PART OF HER 
lbi-1284-1181-0003 THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN YARN AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NECK AND SEVERAL NEAT BRAIDS 
lbi-1284-1181-0004 GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON METAL IN THE LAND OF OZ AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PLIABLE 
lbi-1284-1181-0005 NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRAINS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN 
lbi-1284-1181-0006 WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AGREED MARK A LOT BUT ON THE CONTRARY A SERVANT WITH TOO MUCH BRAINS IS SURE TO BECOME INDEPENDENT AND HIGH AND MIGHTY AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK 
lbi-1284-1181-0007 SHE POURED INTO THE DISH A QUANTITY FROM EACH OF THESE BOTTLES 
lbi-1284-1181-0008 I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QUALITIES ARE NOT NEEDED IN A SERVANT 
lbi-1284-1181-0009 SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND'S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELP HIM LIFT THE FOUR CANDLES FROM THE FIRE 
lbi-1284-1181-0010 THEIR CONTENTS HAD ALL BOILED AWAY LEAVING IN THE BOTTOM OF EACH KETTLE A FEW GRAINS OF FINE WHITE POWDER 
lbi-1284-1181-0011 VERY CAREFULLY THE MAGICIAN REMOVED THIS POWDER PLACING IT ALTOGETHER IN A GOLDEN DISH WHERE HE MIXED IT WITH A GOLDEN SPOON 
lbi-1284-1181-0012 NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE POWDER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBERED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE CUPBOARD 
lbi-1284-1181-0013 OH JOE BECAME A BIT UNEASY AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LOT OF THE CLEVERNESS POWDER IN THE DISH BUT HE DARED NOT INTERFERE IN SO HE COMFORTED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLEVERNESS 
lbi-1284-1181-0014 HE SELECTED A SMALL GOLD BOTTLE WITH A PEPPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE POWDER MIGHT BE SPRINKLED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HOLES 
lbi-1284-1181-0015 MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A RELIEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALKS TO LITTLE 
lbi-1284-1181-0016 I'M NOT ALLOWED TO PERFORM MAGIC EXCEPT FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT HE TOLD HIS VISITORS AS HE LIGHTED A PIPE WITH A CROOKED STEM AND BEGAN TO SMOKE 
lbi-1284-1181-0017 THE WIZARD OF OZ WHO USED TO BE A HUMBUG KNEW NO MAGIC AT ALL HAS BEEN TAKING LESSONS OF GLINDA AND I'M TOLD HE IS GETTING TO BE A PRETTY GOOD WIZARD BUT IS MERELY THE ASSISTANT OF THE GREAT SORCERESS 
lbi-1284-1181-0018 IT TRULY IS ASSERTED THE MAGICIAN 
lbi-1284-1181-0019 I NOW USE THEM AS ORNAMENTAL STATUARY IN MY GARDEN 
lbi-1284-1181-0020 DEAR ME WHAT A CHATTERBOX OR GETTING TO BE DRUNK REMARKED THE MAGICIAN WHO WAS PLEASED WITH THE COMPLIMENT 
lbi-1284-1181-0021 ASKED THE VOICE IN SCORNFUL ACCENTS 
lbi-1284-134647-0000 THE GRATEFUL APPLAUSE OF THE CLERGY HAS CONSECRATED THE MEMORY OF A PRINCE WHO INDULGE THEIR PASSIONS AND PROMOTED THEIR INTEREST 
lbi-1284-134647-0001 THE EDICT OF MILAN THE GREAT CHARTER OF TOLERATION HAD CONFIRMED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE ROMAN WORLD THE PRIVILEGE OF CHOOSING AND PROFESSING HIS OWN RELIGION 
lbi-1284-134647-0002 BUT THIS INESTIMABLE PRIVILEGE WERE SOON VIOLATED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF TRUTH THE EMPEROR IMBIBE THE MAXIMS OF PERSECUTION AND THE SECTS WHICH DISSENTED FROM THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE AFFLICTED AND OPPRESSED BY THE TRIUMPH OF CHRISTIANITY 
lbi-1284-134647-0003 CONSTANTINE EASILY BELIEVED THAT THE HERETICKS WHO PRESUMED TO DISPUTE HIS OPINIONS OR TO OPPOSE HIS COMMANDS WERE GUILTY OF THE MOST ABSURD AND CRIMINAL OBSTINACY AND THAT A SEASONABLE APPLICATION OF MODERATE SEVERITIES MIGHT SAVE THOSE UNHAPPY MEN FROM THE DANGER OF AN EVERLASTING CONDEMNATION 
lbi-1284-134647-0004 SOME OF THE PENAL REGULATIONS WERE COPIED FROM THE EDICTS OF DIOCLETIAN AND THIS METHOD OF CONVERSION WAS APPLAUDED BY THE SAME BISHOPS WHO HAD FELT THE HAND OF OPPRESSION AND PLEADED FOR THE RIGHTS OF HUMANITY 
lbi-1284-134647-0005 THEY ASSERTED WITH CONFIDENCE AND ALMOST WITH EXULTATION THAT THE APOSTOLICAL SUCCESSION WAS INTERRUPTED THAT ALL THE BISHOPS OF EUROPE AND ASIA WERE INFECTED BY THE CONTAGION OF GUILDS AND SCHISM AND THAT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WERE CONFINED TO THE CHOSEN PORTION OF THE AFRICAN BELIEVERS WHO ALONE HAD PRESERVED INVIOLATE THE INTEGRITY OF THEIR FAITH AND DISCIPLINE 
lbi-1284-134647-0006 BISHOPS VIRGINS AND EVEN SPOTLESS INFANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO THE DISGRACE OF A PUBLIC PENANCE BEFORE THEY COULD BE ADMITTED TO THE COMMUNION OF THE DONATISTS 
lbi-1284-134647-0007 PRESCRIBED BY THE CIVIL AND ECCLESIASTICAL POWERS OF THE EMPIRE THE DONATIST STILL MAINTAINED IN SOME PROVINCES PARTICULARLY IN NUMIDIA THEIR SUPERIOR NUMBERS AND FOUR HUNDRED BISHOPS ACKNOWLEDGE THE JURISDICTION OF THEIR PRIMATE 
lbi-1320-122612-0000 SINCE THE PERIOD OF OUR TALE THE ACTIVE SPIRIT OF THE COUNTRY HAS SURROUNDED IT WITH A BELT OF RICH AND THRIVING SETTLEMENTS THOUGH NONE BUT THE HUNTER OR THE SAVAGES EVER KNOWN EVEN NOW TO PENETRATE ITS WILD RECESSES 
lbi-1320-122612-0001 THE DEWS WERE SUFFERED TO EXHALE AND THE SUN HAD DISPERSED THE MISTS AND WAS SHEDDING A STRONG AND CLEAR LIGHT IN THE FOREST WHEN THE TRAVELLERS RESUMED THEIR JOURNEY 
lbi-1320-122612-0002 AFTER PROCEEDING A FEW MILES THE PROGRESS OF HAWKEYE WHO LED THE ADVANCE BECAME MORE DELIBERATE AND WATCHFUL 
lbi-1320-122612-0003 HE OFTEN STOPPED TO EXAMINE THE TREES NOR DID HE CROSS A RIVULET WITHOUT ATTENTIVELY CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY THE VELOCITY AND THE COLOR OF ITS WATERS 
lbi-1320-122612-0004 DISTRUSTING HIS OWN JUDGMENT HIS APPEALS TO THE OPINION OF CHINGACHGOOK WERE FREQUENT AND EARNEST 
lbi-1320-122612-0005 YET HERE WE ARE WITHIN A SHORT RANGE OF THE SCHOOLROOMS AND NOT A SIGN OF A TRAIL HAVE RECROSSED 
lbi-1320-122612-0006 LET US RETRACE OUR STEPS AND EXAMINE AS WE GO WITH KEENER EYES 
lbi-1320-122612-0007 CHINGACHGOOK HAD CAUGHT THE LOOK AND MOTIONING WITH HIS HAND HE BADE HIM SPEAK 
lbi-1320-122612-0008 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY FOLLOWED THE UNEXPECTED MOVEMENT AND READ THEIR SUCCESS IN THE AIR OF TRIUMPH THAT THE YOUTH ASSUMED 
lbi-1320-122612-0009 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WONDERFUL HAD HE SPOKEN WITHOUT A BIDDING 
lbi-1320-122612-0010 SEE PSITTACUS POINTING NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE EVIDENT MARKS OF THE BROAD TRAIL ON EITHER SIDE OF HIM THE DARK HAIR HAS GONE TOWARD THE FOREST 
lbi-1320-122612-0011 IF A ROCK OR A RIVULET OR A BIT OF EARTH HARDER THAN COMMON SEVERED THE LINKS OF THE CLEW THEY FOLLOWED THE TRUE EYE OF THE SCOUT RECOVERED THEM AT A DISTANCE AND SELDOM RENDERED THE DELAY OF A SINGLE MOMENT NECESSARY 
lbi-1320-122612-0012 EXTINGUISHED BRANDS WERE LYING AROUND A SPRING THE OFFALS OF A DEER WERE SCATTERED ABOUT THE PLACE AND THE TREES BORE EVIDENT MARKS OF HAVING BEEN ROUSED BY THE HORSES 
lbi-1320-122612-0013 A CIRCLE OF A FEW HUNDRED FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE WAS DRAWN AND EACH OF THE PARTY TOOK A SEGMENT FOR HIS PORTION 
lbi-1320-122612-0014 THE EXAMINATION HOWEVER RESULTED IN NO DISCOVERY 
lbi-1320-122612-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY CROWDED TO THE SPOT WHERE UNCAS POINTED OUT THE IMPRESSION OF A MOCCASIN IN THE MOIST DILUVIAN 
lbi-1320-122612-0016 RUN BACK ON US AND BRING ME THE SIZE OF THE SINGER'S FOOT 
lbi-1320-122617-0000 NOTWITHSTANDING THE HIGH RESOLUTION OF HAWKEYE HE FULLY COMPREHENDED ALL THE DIFFICULTIES AND DANGER HE WAS ABOUT TO INCUR 
lbi-1320-122617-0001 IN HIS RETURN TO THE CAMP HIS ACUTE UNPRACTICED INTELLECTS WERE INTENTLY ENGAGED IN DEVISING MEANS TO COUNTERACT A WATCHFULNESS AND SUSPICION ON THE PART OF HIS ENEMIES THAT HE KNEW WERE IN NO DEGREE INFERIOR TO HIS OWN 
lbi-1320-122617-0002 IN OTHER WORDS WHILE HE HAD IMPLICIT FAITH IN THE ABILITY OF BAILIFFS ASKED TO SPEAK HE WAS SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL ON THE SUBJECT OF A BEAR'S SINGING AND YET HE HAD BEEN ASSURED OF THE LATTER ON THE TESTIMONY OF HIS OWN EXQUISITE ORGANS 
lbi-1320-122617-0003 THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS AIR AND MANNER THAT BETRAYED TO THE SCOUT THE UTTER CONFUSION OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND 
lbi-1320-122617-0004 THE INGENIOUS HAWKEYE WHO RECALLED THE HASTY MANNER IN WHICH THE OTHER HAD ABANDONED HIS POST AT THE BEDSIDE OF THE SICK WOMAN WAS NOT WITHOUT HIS SUSPICIONS CONCERNING THE SUBJECT OF SO MUCH SOLEMN DELIBERATION 
lbi-1320-122617-0005 THE BEAR SHOOK HIS SHAGGY SIDES AND THEN A WELL KNOWN VOICE REPLIED 
lbi-1320-122617-0006 CAN THESE THINGS BE RETURNED DAVID BREATHING MORE FREELY AS THE TRUTH BEGAN TO DAWN UPON HIM 
lbi-1320-122617-0007 COME COME RETURNED HAWKEYE ENCASING HIS HONEST COUNTENANCE THE BETTER TO ASSURE THE WAVERING CONFIDENCE OF HIS COMPANION YOU MAY SEE A SKIN WHICH IF IT BE NOT AS WHITE AS ONE OF THE GENTLE ONES HAS NO TINGE OF RED TO IT THAT THE WINDS OF THE HEAVEN AND THE SUN HAVE NOT BESTOWED NOW LET US TO BUSINESS 
lbi-1320-122617-0008 THE YOUNG MAN IS IN BONDAGE AND MUCH I FEAR HIS DEATH IS DECREED 
lbi-1320-122617-0009 I GREATLY MOURNED THAT ONE SO WELL DISPOSED SHOULD DIE IN HIS IGNORANCE AND I HAVE SOUGHT A GOODLY HIM CAN YOU LEAD ME TO HIM 
lbi-1320-122617-0010 THE TASK WILL NOT BE DIFFICULT RETURNED DAVID HESITATING THOUGH I GREATLY FEAR YOUR PRESENCE WOULD RATHER INCREASED THAN MITIGATE HIS UNHAPPY FORTUNES 
lbi-1320-122617-0011 THE LODGE IN WHICH AUGUST WAS CONFINED WAS IN THE VERY CENTRE OF THE VILLAGE AND IN A SITUATION PERHAPS MORE DIFFICULT THAN ANY OTHER TO APPROACH OR LEAVE WITHOUT OBSERVATION 
lbi-1320-122617-0012 FOUR OR FIVE OF THE LATTER ONLY LINGERED ABOUT THE DOOR OF THE PRISON OF ANCUS WARY BUT CLOSE OBSERVERS OF THE MANNER OF THEIR CAPTIVE 
lbi-1320-122617-0013 DELIVERED IN A STRONG TONE OF ASSENT ANNOUNCED THE GRATIFICATION THE SAVAGE WOULD RECEIVE AND WITNESSING SUCH AN EXHIBITION OF WEAKNESS AND AN ENEMY SO LONG HATED AND SO MUCH FEARED 
lbi-1320-122617-0014 THEY DREW BACK A LITTLE FROM THE ENTRANCE AND MOTIONED TO THE SUPPOSED CONJURER TO ENTER 
lbi-1320-122617-0015 BUT THE BEAR INSTEAD OF OBEYING MAINTAINED THE SEATED HAD TAKEN AND GROWLED 
lbi-1320-122617-0016 THE CUNNING MAN IS AFRAID THAT HIS BREATH WILL BLOW UPON HIS BROTHERS AND TAKE AWAY THEIR COURAGE TOO CONTINUED DAVID AND PROVING THE HAND HE RECEIVED THEY MUST STAND FURTHER OFF 
lbi-1320-122617-0017 THEN AS IF SATISFIED OF THEIR SAFETY THE SCOUT LEFT HIS POSITION AND SLOWLY ENTERED THE PLACE 
lbi-1320-122617-0018 IT WAS SILENT AND GLOOMY BEING TENANTED SOLELY BY THE CAPTIVE AND LIGHTED BY THE DYING EMBERS OF A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF COOKERY 
lbi-1320-122617-0019 UNCAS OCCUPIED A DISTANT CORNER IN A RECLINING ATTITUDE BEING RIGIDLY BOUND BOTH HANDS AND FEET BY STRONG AND PAINFUL WITHS 
lbi-1320-122617-0020 THE SCOUT WHO HAD LEFT DAVID AT THE DOOR TO ASCERTAIN THEY WERE NOT OBSERVED THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO PRESERVE HIS DISGUISE UNTIL ASSURED OF THEIR PRIVACY 
lbi-1320-122617-0021 WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH THE MINGOS AT THE DOOR THEY COUNT SIX AND THE SINGER IS AS GOOD AS NOTHING 
lbi-1320-122617-0022 THE DELAWARES ARE CHILDREN OF THE TORTOISE AND THEY OUTSTRIP THE DEER 
lbi-1320-122617-0023 UNCLES WHO HAD ALREADY APPROACHED THE DOOR IN READINESS TO LEAD THE WAY NOW RECOILED AND PLACED HIMSELF ONCE MORE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE LODGE 
lbi-1320-122617-0024 BUT HAWKEYE WHO WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED WITH HIS OWN THOUGHTS TO NOTE THE MOVEMENT CONTINUED SPEAKING MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO HIS COMPANION 
lbi-1320-122617-0025 SO IN CASE YOU HAD BETTER TAKE THE LEAD WHILE I WILL PUT ON THE SKIN AGAIN AND TRUST TOO CUNNING FOR WANT OF SPEED 
lbi-1320-122617-0026 WELL WHAT CAN BE DONE BY MAIN COURAGE IN WAR MUST BE DONE BY CIRCUMVENTION 
lbi-1320-122617-0027 AS SOON AS THESE DISPOSITIONS WERE MADE THE SCOUT TURNED TO DAVID AND GAVE HIM HIS PARTING INSTRUCTIONS 
lbi-1320-122617-0028 MY PURSUITS ARE PEACEFUL AND MY TEMPER I HUMBLY TRUST IS GREATLY GIVEN TO MERCY AND LOVE RETURNED DAVID A LITTLE NETTLED AT SO DIRECT AN ATTACK ON HIS MANHOOD BUT THERE ARE NONE WHO CAN SAY THAT I HAVE EVER FORGOTTEN MY FAITH IN THE LORD EVEN IN THE GREATEST STRAITS 
lbi-1320-122617-0029 IF YOU'RE NOT THEN KNOCKED ON THE HEAD YOUR BEING A NON COMMISSIONED OFFICER WILL PROTECT YOU AND YOU'LL THEN HAVE A GOOD REASON TO EXPECT TO DIE IN YOUR BED 
lbi-1320-122617-0030 SO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF TO MAKE A RUSH OR TARRY HERE 
lbi-1320-122617-0031 BRAVELY AND GENEROUSLY AS HE BATTLED IN MY BEHALF AND THIS AND MORE WILL I DARE IN HIS SERVICE 
lbi-1320-122617-0032 KEEP SILENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE WISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHOUTINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO REMIND THE INDIANS THAT YOU ARE NOT ALTOGETHER AS RESPONSIBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE 
lbi-1320-122617-0033 IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SCALP AS I TRUST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEPEND ON IT A KISS AND I WILL NOT FORGET THE DEED BUT REVENGE IT IS BECOMES TRUE WARRIORS AND TRUSTY FRIENDS 
lbi-1320-122617-0034 HOLD SAID DAVID PERCEIVING THAT WITH THIS ASSURANCE THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM I AM AN UNWORTHY AN HUMBLE FOLLOWER OF ONE WHO TAUGHT NOT THE DAMNABLE PRINCIPLE OF REVENGE 
lbi-1320-122617-0035 THEN HEAVING A HEAVY SIGH PROBABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN PINING FOR A CONDITION HE HAD SO LONG ABANDONED HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACTISE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT A CROSS OF BLOOD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO DEAL WITH AN INDIAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRISTIAN 
lbi-1320-122617-0036 GOD BLESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOU'RE SENT IS NOT GREATLY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DULY CONSIDERED AND KEEPING ETERNITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEPENDS ON THE NATURAL GIFTS AND THE FORCE OF TEMPTATION 
lbi-1320-122617-0037 THE DELAWARE DOG HE SAID LEANING FORWARD AND PEERING THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT TO CATCH THE EXPRESSION OF THE OTHER'S FEATURES IS HE AFRAID 
lbi-1320-122617-0038 WILL THE HERONS HEAR HIS GROANS 
lbi-1320-122617-0039 THE MOHICAN STARTED ON HIS FEET AND SHOOK HIS SHAGGY COVERING AS THOUGH THE ANIMAL HE COUNTERFEITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESPERATE EFFORT 
lbi-1320-122617-0040 HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DELAY FOR AT THE NEXT INSTANT A BURST OF CRIES FILLED THE OUTER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE VILLAGE 
lbi-1320-122617-0041 UNCAS CAST HIS SKIN AND STEPPED FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROPORTIONS 
lbi-1580-141083-0000 I WILL ENDEAVOUR IN MY STATEMENT TO AVOID SUCH TERMS AS WOULD SERVE TO LIMIT THE EVENTS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CLUE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNED 
lbi-1580-141083-0001 I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE RESTLESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL HAD OCCURRED 
lbi-1580-141083-0002 MY FRIEND'S TEMPER HAD NOT IMPROVED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THE CONGENIAL SURROUNDINGS OF BAKER STREET 
lbi-1580-141083-0003 WITHOUT HIS SCRAP BOOKS HIS CHEMICALS AND HIS HOMELY UNTIDINESS HE WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE MAN 
lbi-1580-141083-0004 I HAD TO READ IT OVER CAREFULLY AS THE TEXT MUST BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT 
lbi-1580-141083-0005 I WAS ABSENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR 
lbi-1580-141083-0006 THE ONLY DUPLICATE WHICH EXISTED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONGED TO MY SERVANT BANNISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HONESTY IS ABSOLUTELY ABOVE SUSPICION 
lbi-1580-141083-0007 THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AWARE THAT SOMEONE HAD RUMMAGED AMONG MY PAPERS 
lbi-1580-141083-0008 THE PROOF WAS IN THREE LONG SLIPS I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER 
lbi-1580-141083-0009 THE ALTERNATIVE WAS THAT SOMEONE PASSING HAD OBSERVED THE KEY IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPERS 
lbi-1580-141083-0010 I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRANDY LEFT HIM COLLAPSED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE ROOM 
lbi-1580-141083-0011 A BROKEN TIP OF LEAD WAS LYING THERE ALSO 
lbi-1580-141083-0012 NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL BALL OF BLACK DUST OR CLAY WITH SPECKS OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOKS LIKE SAWDUST IN IT 
lbi-1580-141083-0013 ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SETTLE THE MATTER QUIETLY AND DISCREETLY 
lbi-1580-141083-0014 TO THE BEST OF MY BELIEF THEY WERE ROLLED UP 
lbi-1580-141083-0015 DID ANYONE KNOW THAT THESE PROOFS WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRINTER 
lbi-1580-141083-0016 I WAS IN SUCH A HURRY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN 
lbi-1580-141083-0017 SO IT SEEMS TO ME 
lbi-1580-141083-0018 NOW MISTER SOLMES AT YOUR DISPOSAL 
lbi-1580-141083-0019 ABOVE WERE THREE STUDENTS ONE ON EACH STORY 
lbi-1580-141083-0020 THEN HE APPROACHED IT AND STANDING ON TIPTOE WITH HIS NECK CRANED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM 
lbi-1580-141083-0021 THERE IS NO OPENING EXCEPT THE ONE PAINTING SET OUR LEARNED GUIDE 
lbi-1580-141083-0022 I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGNS HERE SAID HE 
lbi-1580-141083-0023 ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DRY A DAY 
lbi-1580-141083-0024 YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE 
lbi-1580-141083-0025 THE MEN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPERS SHEET BY SHEET FROM THE CENTRAL TABLE 
lbi-1580-141083-0026 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SOAMES FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR 
lbi-1580-141083-0027 HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT USING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTRACTION A QUARTER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS 
lbi-1580-141083-0028 THEN HE TOSSED IT DOWN AND SEIZED THE NEXT 
lbi-1580-141083-0029 HE WAS IN THE MIDST OF THAT WHEN YOU RETURN CAUSED HIM TO MAKE A VERY HURRIED RETREAT VERY HURRIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REPLACE THE PAPERS WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE 
lbi-1580-141083-0030 MISTER SOLMES WAS SOMEWHAT OVERWHELMED BY THIS FLOOD OF INFORMATION 
lbi-1580-141083-0031 HOLMES HELD OUT A SMALL CHIP WITH THE LETTERS N N AND A SPACE OF CLEAR WOULD AFTER THEM YOU SEE 
lbi-1580-141083-0032 WATSON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN INJUSTICE THERE ARE OTHERS 
lbi-1580-141083-0033 I WAS HOPING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WROTE WAS THIN SOME TRACE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POLISHED SURFACE NO I SEE NOTHING 
lbi-1580-141083-0034 AS HOLMES DREW THE CURTAIN I WAS AWARE FROM SOME LITTLE RIGIDITY AND AN ALERTNESS OF HIS ATTITUDE THAT HE WAS PREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY 
lbi-1580-141083-0035 HOLMES TURNED AWAY AND STOOPED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HELLO WHAT IS THIS 
lbi-1580-141083-0036 HOLMES SHOUTED OUT ON HIS OPEN PALM IN THE GLARE OF THE ELECTRIC LIGHT 
lbi-1580-141083-0037 WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BETRAY HIM AND HE RUSHED INTO YOUR BEDROOM TO CONCEAL HIMSELF 
lbi-1580-141083-0038 I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUDENTS WHO USE THIS STAIR AND ARE IN THE HABIT OF PASSING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE 
lbi-1580-141083-0039 AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAMINATION YES 
lbi-1580-141083-0040 ONE HARDLY LIKES TO THROW SUSPICION WHERE THERE ARE NO PROOFS 
lbi-1580-141083-0041 LET US HEAR THE SUSPICIONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PROOFS 
lbi-1580-141083-0042 MY SCHOLAR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORKING AND INDUSTRIOUS HE WILL DO WELL 
lbi-1580-141083-0043 THE TOP FLOOR BELONGS TO MOLL'S MACLAREN 
lbi-1580-141083-0044 I DARE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UNLIKELY 
lbi-1580-141083-0045 HE WAS STILL SUFFERING FROM THE SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF THE QUIET ROUTINE OF HIS LIFE 
lbi-1580-141083-0046 BUT I HAVE OCCASIONALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES 
lbi-1580-141083-0047 DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPERS ON THE TABLE 
lbi-1580-141083-0048 HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KEY IN THE DOOR 
lbi-1580-141083-0049 ANYONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR 
lbi-1580-141083-0050 I REALLY DON'T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MISTER HOLMES 
lbi-1580-141083-0051 ONLY FOR A MINUTE OR SO 
lbi-1580-141083-0052 OH I WOULD NOT VENTURE TO SAY SIR 
lbi-1580-141083-0053 YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THEM KNOW SIR 
lbi-1580-141084-0000 IT WAS THE INDIAN WHOSE DARK SILHOUETTE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BLIND 
lbi-1580-141084-0001 HE WAS PACING SWIFTLY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM 
lbi-1580-141084-0002 THE SET OF ROOMS IS QUITE THE OLDEST IN THE COLLEGE AND IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR VISITORS TO GO OVER THEM 
lbi-1580-141084-0003 NO NAMES PLEASE SAID HOLMES AS WE KNOCKED AT GILCHRIST DOOR 
lbi-1580-141084-0004 OF COURSE HE DID NOT REALIZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KNOCKING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS CONDUCT WAS VERY COURTEOUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES RATHER SUSPICIOUS 
lbi-1580-141084-0005 THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT SAID HOLMES 
lbi-1580-141084-0006 YOU DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE THE POSITION 
lbi-1580-141084-0007 TOMORROW WAS THE EXAMINATION 
lbi-1580-141084-0008 I CANNOT ALLOW THE EXAMINATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPERS HAS BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE SITUATION MUST BE FACED 
lbi-1580-141084-0009 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO INDICATE SOME COURSE OF ACTION 
lbi-1580-141084-0010 I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CLAY WITH ME ALSO THE PENCIL CUTTINGS GOODBYE 
lbi-1580-141084-0011 WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE QUADRANGLE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOWS 
lbi-1580-141084-0012 THE FOUL MOUTHED FELLOW AT THE TOP 
lbi-1580-141084-0013 HE IS THE ONE WITH THE WORST RECORD 
lbi-1580-141084-0014 WHY BANISTER THE SERVANT WHAT'S HIS GAME IN THE MATTER 
lbi-1580-141084-0015 HE IMPRESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECTLY HONEST MAN 
lbi-1580-141084-0016 MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEPRESSED BY HIS FAILURE BUT SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND HALF HUMOROUS RESIGNATION 
lbi-1580-141084-0017 NO GOOD MY DEAR WATSON 
lbi-1580-141084-0018 I THINK SO YOU HAVE FORMED A CONCLUSION 
lbi-1580-141084-0019 YES MY DEAR WATSON I HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY 
lbi-1580-141084-0020 LOOK AT THAT HE HELD OUT HIS HAND 
lbi-1580-141084-0021 ON THE PALM WERE THREE LITTLE PYRAMIDS OF BLACK DOUGHY CLAY 
lbi-1580-141084-0022 AND ONE MORE THIS MORNING 
lbi-1580-141084-0023 IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAMINATION WOULD COMMENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE DILEMMA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACTS PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE CULPRIT TO COMPETE FOR THE SCHOLARSHIP 
lbi-1580-141084-0024 HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MENTAL AGITATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HOMES WITH TWO EAGER HANDS OUTSTRETCHED THANK HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME 
lbi-1580-141084-0025 YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO 
lbi-1580-141084-0026 IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OURSELVES CERTAIN POWERS AND RESOLVE OURSELVES INTO A SMALL PRIVATE COURT MARTIAL 
lbi-1580-141084-0027 NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT 
lbi-1580-141084-0028 THERE WAS NO MAN SIR 
lbi-1580-141084-0029 HIS TROUBLED BLUE EYES GLANCED AT EACH OF US AND FINALLY RESTED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF BLANK DISMAY UPON BANNISTER IN THE FARTHER CORNER 
lbi-1580-141084-0030 JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HOLMES 
lbi-1580-141084-0031 WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GILCHRIST HOW YOU AN HONORABLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMMIT SUCH AN ACTION AS THAT OF YESTERDAY 
lbi-1580-141084-0032 FOR A MOMENT GILCHRIST WITH UPRAISED HAND TRIED TO CONTROL HIS WRITHING FEATURES 
lbi-1580-141084-0033 COME COME SAID HOLMES KINDLY IT IS HUMAN TO ERR AND AT LEAST NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF BEING A CALLOUS CRIMINAL 
lbi-1580-141084-0034 WELL DON'T TROUBLE TO ANSWER LISTEN AND SEE THAT I DO YOU NO INJUSTICE 
lbi-1580-141084-0035 HE COULD EXAMINE THE PAPERS IN HIS OWN OFFICE 
lbi-1580-141084-0036 THE INDIAN I ALSO THOUGHT NOTHING OF 
lbi-1580-141084-0037 WHEN I APPROACHED YOUR ROOM I EXAMINED THE WINDOW 
lbi-1580-141084-0038 NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE 
lbi-1580-141084-0039 I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY CONFIDENCE AS TO THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE SIDE TABLE 
lbi-1580-141084-0040 HE RETURNED CARRYING HIS JUMPING SHOES WHICH ARE PROVIDED AS YOU ARE AWARE WITH SEVERAL SHARP SPIKES 
lbi-1580-141084-0041 NO HARM WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PERCEIVED THE KEY WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARELESSNESS OF YOUR SERVANT 
lbi-1580-141084-0042 A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THE PROOFS 
lbi-1580-141084-0043 HE PUT HIS SHOES ON THE TABLE 
lbi-1580-141084-0044 GLOVES SAID THE YOUNG MAN 
lbi-1580-141084-0045 SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIM AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESCAPE 
lbi-1580-141084-0046 HAVE I TOLD THE TRUTH MISTER GILCHRIST 
lbi-1580-141084-0047 I HAVE A LETTER HERE MISTER SOLMES WHICH I WROTE TO YOU EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A RESTLESS NIGHT 
lbi-1580-141084-0048 IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT 
lbi-1580-141084-0049 IT WAS SIMPLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLEVERNESS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW 
lbi-1580-141084-0050 IF MISTER SOAMES SAW THEM THE GAME WAS UP 
lbi-1995-1826-0000 IN THE DEBATE BETWEEN THE SENIOR SOCIETIES HER DEFENCE OF THE FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOTABLE BIT OF REASONING BUT DELIVERED WITH REAL ENTHUSIASM 
lbi-1995-1826-0001 THE SOUTH SHE HAD NOT THOUGHT OF SERIOUSLY AND YET KNOWING OF ITS DELIGHTFUL HOSPITALITY AND MILD CLIMATE SHE WAS NOT AVERSE TO CHARLESTON OR NEW ORLEANS 
lbi-1995-1826-0002 JOHN TAYLOR WHO HAD SUPPORTED HER THROUGH COLLEGE WAS INTERESTED IN COTTON 
lbi-1995-1826-0003 BETTER GO HE HAD COUNSELLED SENTENTIOUSLY 
lbi-1995-1826-0004 MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING USEFUL DOWN THERE 
lbi-1995-1826-0005 BUT JOHN HAS NO SOCIETY JUST ELEMENTARY WORK 
lbi-1995-1826-0006 THEN LOOKING UP TOMBS COUNTY 
lbi-1995-1826-0007 FISON CRESSWELL'S FER BIG PLANTATIONS RATED AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS 
lbi-1995-1826-0008 SOME OTHERS TOO BIG COTTON COUNTY 
lbi-1995-1826-0009 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES ELSE SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS 
lbi-1995-1826-0010 AT ANY RATE I SAY GO 
lbi-1995-1826-0011 HERE SHE WAS TEACHING DIRTY CHILDREN AND THE SMELL OF CONFUSED ODORS AND BODILY PERSPIRATION WAS TO HER AT TIMES UNBEARABLE 
lbi-1995-1826-0012 SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS 
lbi-1995-1826-0013 SO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TO DAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE BOTTOMS 
lbi-1995-1826-0014 COTTON SHE PAUSED 
lbi-1995-1826-0015 SHE HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THAT IT WAS HERE WITHIN TOUCH AND SIGHT 
lbi-1995-1826-0016 THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD 
lbi-1995-1826-0017 THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF HIS PLACE WITH SUCH DESPERATE PROSE 
lbi-1995-1826-0018 HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AS SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY 
lbi-1995-1826-0019 COTTON IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY 
lbi-1995-1826-0020 MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARKED SEEMED CALLED FOR 
lbi-1995-1826-0021 DON'T KNOW WHICH OF ALL THINGS INWARDLY COMMENTED MISS TAYLOR LITERALLY BORN AND COTTON AND OH WELL AS MUCH AS TO ASK WHAT'S THE USE SHE TURNED AGAIN TO GO 
lbi-1995-1826-0022 I SUPPOSE THOUGH IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THEM THEN CAME THE EXPLOSION 
lbi-1995-1826-0023 GIRLS DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS OF ASTHMA ON DE GROUN OLMUETZ LEGUMES IS THAT SO 
lbi-1995-1826-0024 THE GOLDEN FLEECE IF THE SILVER FLEECE HE HEARKENED 
lbi-1995-1826-0025 SOME DAMN YOU DAMN PLEASE WON'T YOU 
lbi-1995-1826-0026 NOW FOR ONE LITTLE HALF HOUR SHE HAD BEEN A WOMAN TALKING TO A BOY NO NOT EVEN THAT SHE HAD BEEN TALKING JUST TALKING THERE WERE NO PERSONS IN THE CONVERSATION JUST THINGS ONE THING COTTON 
lbi-1995-1836-0000 THE HONORABLE CHARLES SMITH MISS SARAH'S BROTHER WAS WALKING SWIFTLY UP TOWN FOR MISTER EASTERLY WALL STREET OFFICE AND HIS FACE WAS PALE 
lbi-1995-1836-0001 AT LAST THE COTTON COMBINE WAS TO ALL APPEARANCES AN ASSURED FACT AND HE WAS SLATED FOR THE SENATE 
lbi-1995-1836-0002 WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE AS OTHER MEN 
lbi-1995-1836-0003 SHE WAS NOT HERSELF A NOTABLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN SHE GREATLY ADMIRED INTELLIGENCE OR WHATEVER LOOKED TO HER LIKE INTELLIGENCE IN OTHERS 
lbi-1995-1836-0004 AS SHE AWAITED HER GUESS SHE SURVEYED THE TABLE WITH BOTH SATISFACTION AND AS QUIETUDE FOR HER SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE FEW TONIGHT THERE WERE SHE CHECKED THEM OFF ON HER FINGERS SIR JAMES CHRIGHTON THE RICH ENGLISH MANUFACTURER AND LADY CHRIGHTON MISTER AND MISSUS VANDERPOOL MISTER HARRY CRESSWELL AND HIS SISTER JOHN TAYLOR AND HIS SISTER AND MISTER CHARLES SMITH WHOM THE EVENING PAPERS MENTIONED AS LIKELY TO BE UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY A SELECTION OF GAS THAT HAD BEEN DETERMINED UNKNOWN TO THE HOSTESS BY THE MEETING OF COTTON INTEREST EARLIER IN THE DAY 
lbi-1995-1836-0005 MISSUS GRAY HAD MET SOUTHERNERS BEFORE BUT NOT INTIMATELY AND SHE ALWAYS HAD IN MIND VIVIDLY THEIR CRUELTY TO POOR NEGROES A SUBJECT SHE MADE A POINT OF INTRODUCING FORTHWITH 
lbi-1995-1836-0006 SHE WAS THEREFORE MOST AGREEABLY SURPRISED TO HEAR MISTER CRESSWELL EXPRESS HIMSELF SO CORDIALLY AS APPROVING OF NEGRO EDUCATION 
lbi-1995-1836-0007 DO YOU BELIEVE IN SOME EDUCATION ASKED MARY TAYLOR 
lbi-1995-1836-0008 I BELIEVE IN THE TRAINED ENOUGH PEOPLE TO THEIR HAS CAPACITY THE ENGLISHMAN HERE HEARTILY SECONDED HIM 
lbi-1995-1836-0009 BUT CRESSWELL ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY CAPACITY DIFFERS IN NO MONTHS NAY BETWEEN RACES 
lbi-1995-1836-0010 EVANDER POOLS WERE SURE OF THIS AND THE ENGLISHMAN INSTANCING INDIA BECAME QUITE ELOQUENT MISSUS GRAY WAS MYSTIFIED BUT HARDLY DARED ADMIT IT THE GENERAL TREND OF THE CONVERSATION SEEMED TO BE THAT MOST INDIVIDUALS NEEDED TO BE SUBMITTED TO THE SHARPER SCRUTINY BEFORE BEING ALLOWED MUCH EDUCATION AND AS FOR THE LOWER RACES IT WAS SIMPLY CRIMINAL TO OPEN SUCH USELESS OPPORTUNITIES TO THEM 
lbi-1995-1836-0011 WHILE ACTIVELY HEROIC ADDED CRESSWELL AVOIDING HIS SISTER'S EYES 
lbi-1995-1836-0012 BUT WHEN NADA EXACTLY WELCOME 
lbi-1995-1836-0013 MARY TAYLOR HOWEVER RELATED THE TALE OF ZOLA TO MISSUS GRAY'S PRIVATE EAR LATER 
lbi-1995-1836-0014 FORTUNATELY SAID MISTER VANDERPOOL NORTHERNERS AND SOUTHERNERS ALL ROBBING OUT ABOUT A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING ON MOST OF THESE MATTERS 
lbi-1995-1837-0000 HE KNEW THE SILVER FLEECE HIS AND YOURS MUST BE RUINED 
lbi-1995-1837-0001 IT WAS THE FIRST GREAT SORROW OF HIS LIFE IT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE LOSS OF A COTTON ITSELF BUT THE FANTASY THE HOPES THE DREAMS BUILT AROUND IT 
lbi-1995-1837-0002 AH THE SWAMP THE COOL SUAVE 
lbi-1995-1837-0003 THE REVELATION OF HIS LOVE LIGHTED AND BRIGHTEN SLOWLY TILL IT FLAMED LIKE A SUNRISE OVER HIM AND LEFT HIM IN VERNON WONDERED 
lbi-1995-1837-0004 HE PANTED TO KNOW IF SHE TOO KNEW OR KNEW AND CARED NOT FOR CAIRD AND KNEW NOT 
lbi-1995-1837-0005 SHE WAS SO STRANGE AND HUMAN A CREATURE 
lbi-1995-1837-0006 THE WORLD WAS WATER VEILED IN MISTS 
lbi-1995-1837-0007 THEN OF A SUDDEN AT MIDDAY THE SUN SHOT OUT HOT AND STILL NO BREATH OF AIR STIRRED THE SKY WAS LIKE BLUE STEEL THE EARTH STEAMED 
lbi-1995-1837-0008 WHERE WAS THE USE OF IMAGINING 
lbi-1995-1837-0009 THE LAGOON HAD BEEN LEVEL WITH THE DOGS A WEEK AGO AND NOW 
lbi-1995-1837-0010 PERHAPS SHE TOO MIGHT BE THERE WAITING WEEPING 
lbi-1995-1837-0011 HE STARTED AT THE THOUGHT HE HURRIED FORTH SADLY 
lbi-1995-1837-0012 HE SPLASHED A STAMPED ALONG FARTHER AND FARTHER ONWARD UNTIL HE NEARED THE RAMPART OF THE CLEARING AND PUT FOOT UPON THE TREE BRIDGE 
lbi-1995-1837-0013 THEN HE LOOKED DOWN THE LAGOON WAS DRY 
lbi-1995-1837-0014 HE STOOD A MOMENT BEWILDERED THEN TURNED AND RUSHED UPON THE ISLAND A GREAT SHEET OF DAZZLING SUNLIGHT SWEPT THE PLACE AND BENEATH LAY A MIGHTY MASS OF OLIVE GREEN THE TALL WET AND WILLOWY 
lbi-1995-1837-0015 THE SQUARES OF COTTON SHARP EDGED HEAVY WERE JUST ABOUT TO BURST TO BOLLES 
lbi-1995-1837-0016 FOR ONE LONG MOMENT HE PAUSED STUPID AGAPE WITH UTTER AMAZEMENT THEN LEANED DIZZILY AGAINST A TREE 
lbi-1995-1837-0017 HE GAZED ABOUT PERPLEXED ASTONISHED 
lbi-1995-1837-0018 HERE LAY THE READING OF THE RIDDLE WITH INFINITE WORK AND PAIN SOMEONE HAD DUG A CANAL FROM THE LAGOON TO THE CREEK INTO WHICH THE FORMER HAD DRAINED BY A LONG AND CROOKED WAY THUS ALLOWING IT TO EMPTY DIRECTLY 
lbi-1995-1837-0019 HE SAT DOWN WEAK BEWILDERED AND ONE THOUGHT WAS UPPERMOST SORA 
lbi-1995-1837-0020 THE YEARS OF THE DAYS OF HER DYING WERE TEN 
lbi-1995-1837-0021 THE HOPE AND DREAM OF HARVEST WAS UPON THE LAND 
lbi-1995-1837-0022 UP IN THE SICK ROOMS OR LAY ON THE LITTLE WHITE BED 
lbi-1995-1837-0023 THEN NED AND WEB OF ENDLESS THINGS HAD BEEN CRAWLING AND CREEPING AROUND HER SHE HAD STRUGGLED AND DUMB SPEECHLESS TERROR AGAINST SOME MIGHTY GRASPING THAT STROVE FOR HER LIFE WITH GNARLED AND CREEPING FINGERS BUT NOW AT LAST WEAKLY SHE OPENED HER EYES AND QUESTION 
lbi-1995-1837-0024 FOR AWHILE SHE LAY IN HER CHAIR IN HAPPY DREAMY PLEASURE ITS SUN AND BIRD AND TREE 
lbi-1995-1837-0025 SHE ROSE WITH A FLEETING GLANCE GATHERED THE SHAWL AROUND HER THEN GLIDING FORWARD WAVERING TREMULOUS SLIPPED ACROSS THE ROAD AND INTO THE SWAMP 
lbi-1995-1837-0026 SHE HAD BEEN BORN WITHIN ITS BORDERS WITHIN HIS BORDERS SHE HAD LIVED AND GROWN AND WITHIN ITS BORDERS SHE HAD MET HER LOVE 
lbi-1995-1837-0027 ON SHE HURRIED UNTIL SWEEPING DOWN TO THE LAGOON AND THE ISLAND LO THE COTTON LAY BEFORE HER 
lbi-1995-1837-0028 THE CHAIR WAS EMPTY BUT HE KNEW 
lbi-1995-1837-0029 HE DARTED THROUGH THE TREES AND PAUSED A TALL MAN STRONGLY BUT SLIMLY MADE 
lbi-2094-142345-0000 IT IS A VERY FINE OLD PLACE OF RED BRICK SOFTENED BY A PALE POWDERY LICHEN WHICH HAS DISPERSED ITSELF WITH HAPPY IRREGULARITY SO AS TO BRING THE RED BRICK INTO TERMS OF FRIENDLY COMPANIONSHIP WITH LIMESTONE ORNAMENTS SURROUNDING THE THREE GABLES THE WINDOWS AND THE DOOR PLACE 
lbi-2094-142345-0001 BUT THE WINDOWS ARE PATCHED WITH WOODEN PANES AND THE DOOR I THINK IS LIKE THE GATE IT IS NEVER OPENED 
lbi-2094-142345-0002 FOR IT IS A SOLID HEAVY HANDSOME DOOR AND MUST ONCE HAVE BEEN IN THE HABIT OF SHUTTING WITH A SONOROUS BANG BEHIND THE LIVERIED LACKEY WHO HAD JUST SEEN HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS OFF THE GROUNDS IN A CARRIAGE AND PAIR 
lbi-2094-142345-0003 A LARGE OPEN FIREPLACE WITH RUSTY DOGS IN IT AND THE BARE BOARDED FLOOR AT THE FAR END FLEECES OF WOOL STACKED UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR SOME EMPTY CORN BAGS 
lbi-2094-142345-0004 AND WHAT THROUGH THE LEFT HAND WINDOW 
lbi-2094-142345-0005 SEVERAL CLOTHES HORSES A PILLION A SPINNING WHEEL AND AN OLD BOX WIDE OPEN AND STUFFED FULL OF COLOURED RAGS 
lbi-2094-142345-0006 AT THE EDGE OF THIS BOX THERE LIES A GREAT WOODEN DOLL WHICH SO FAR AS MUTILATION AS CONCERN BEARS A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE FINEST GREEK SCULPTURE AND ESPECIALLY IN THE TOTAL LOSS OF ITS NOSE 
lbi-2094-142345-0007 THE HISTORY OF THE HOUSE IS PLAIN NOW 
lbi-2094-142345-0008 BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A STRONGER SENSE OF LIFE WHEN THE SUN IS BRILLIANT AFTER RAIN AND NOW HE IS POURING DOWN HIS BEAMS AND MAKING SPARKLES AMONG THE WET STRAW AND LIGHTING UP EVERY PATCH OF VIVID GREEN MOSS ON THE RED TILES OF THE COW SHED AND TURNING EVEN THE MUDDY WATER THAT IS HURRYING ALONG THE CHANNEL TO THE DRAIN INTO A MIRROR FOR THE YELLOW BILLED DUCKS WHO WERE SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING A DRINK WITH AS MUCH BODY AND IT IS POSSIBLE 
lbi-2094-142345-0009 WHERE THE GREAT BARN DOORS ARE THROWN WIDE OPEN AND MEN ARE BUSY THERE MENDING THE HARNESS UNDER THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF MISTER GOBI THE WICHITA OTHERWISE SADDLER WHO ENTERTAINS THEM WITH THE LATEST TREADLES AND GOSSIP 
lbi-2094-142345-0010 HETTY SORREL OFTEN TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WHEN HER AUNT'S BACK WAS TURNED OF LOOKING AT THE PLEASING REFLECTION OF HERSELF IN THOSE POLISHED SERVICES FOR THE OAK TABLE WAS USUALLY TURNED UP LIKE A SCREEN AND WAS MORE FOR ORNAMENT THAN FOR USE AND SHE COULD SEE HERSELF SOMETIMES IN THE GREAT ROUND PEWTER DISHES THERE WERE ARRANGED ON THE SHELVES ABOVE THE LONG DEAL DINNER TABLE OR IN THE HOBS OF THE GREAT WHICH ALWAYS SHONE LIKE JASPER 
lbi-2094-142345-0011 DO NOT SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT MISSUS POYSER WAS ELDERLY OR SHREWISH IN HER APPEARANCE SHE WAS A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN NOT MORE THAN EIGHT AND THIRTY A FAIR COMPLEXION AND SANDY HAIR WELL SHAPEN LIGHTFOOTED 
lbi-2094-142345-0012 THE FAMILY LIKENESS BETWEEN HER AND HER NIECE DINAH MORRIS WITH A CONTRAST BETWEEN HER KEENNESS AND DINAH'S SERAPHIC GENTLENESS OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SERVED A PAINTER AS AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION FOR A MARTHA AND MARY 
lbi-2094-142345-0013 HER TONGUE WAS NOT LESS KEEN THAN HER EYE AND WHENEVER A DAMSEL CAME WITHIN EAR SHOT SEEMED TO TAKE UP AN UNFINISHED LECTURE AS A BARREL ORGAN TAKES UP A TUNE PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE IT HAD LEFT OFF 
lbi-2094-142345-0014 THE FACT THAT IT WAS CHURNING DAY WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY IT WAS INCONVENIENT TO HAVE THE WITNESS AND WHY CONSEQUENTLY MISSUS POYSER'S SHOULD SCOLD MOLLY THE HOUSEMAID WITH UNUSUAL SEVERITY 
lbi-2094-142345-0015 TO ALL APPEARANCE MOLLY HAD GOT THROUGH HER AFTER DINNER WORK IN AN EXEMPLARY MANNER HAD CLEANED HERSELF WITH GREAT DESPATCH AND NOW CAME TO ASK SUBMISSIVELY IF SHE SHOULD SIT DOWN TO HER SPINNING TILL MILKING TIME 
lbi-2094-142345-0016 SPINNING INDEED 
lbi-2094-142345-0017 I NEVER KNEW YOUR EQUALS FOR GALLOWS NUSS

lbi-2094-142345-0029 DID EVER ANYBODY SEE THE LIKE SCREAMED MISSUS POYSER RUNNING TOWARDS THE TABLE WHEN HER EYE HAD FALLEN ON THE BLUE STREAM 
lbi-2094-142345-0030 TOTTY HOWEVER HAD DESCENDED FROM HER CHAIR WITH GREAT SWIFTNESS AND WAS ALREADY IN RETREAT TOWARDS THE DAIRY WITH A SORT OF WADDLING RUN AND AN AMOUNT OF FAT ON THE NAPE OF HER NECK WHICH MADE HER LOOK LIKE THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A WHITE SUCKLING PIG 
lbi-2094-142345-0031 AND SHE WAS VERY FOND OF YOU TOO AUNT RACHEL 
lbi-2094-142345-0032 I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
