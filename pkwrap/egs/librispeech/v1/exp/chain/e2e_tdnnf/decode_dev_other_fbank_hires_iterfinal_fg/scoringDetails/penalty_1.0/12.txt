lbi-116-288045-0000 AS I APPROACHED THE CITY I HEARD BELLS RINGING AND THOUGH LATER I FOUND THE STREETS A STIR WITH THRONGS OF WELL DRESSED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GROUPS WINDING THEIR WAY HITHER AND THITHER 
lbi-116-288045-0001 LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NEAT BLACK DRESS SMILING AND HIS HAND EXTENDED TO ME WITH GREAT CORDIALITY 
lbi-116-288045-0002 HE MUST HAVE REALIZED I WAS A STRANGER AND WISHED YOU TO ENTER HIS HOSPITALITY TO ME I ACCEPTED IT GRATEFULLY I CLASPED HIS HAND HE PRESSED MINE 
lbi-116-288045-0003 WE GAZED FOR A MOMENT SLYLY INTO EACH OTHER'S EYES

lbi-116-288045-0008 BUT THE GREEKS LOVED THEIR GODS ARE PROTESTED MAR CLERIMONT BREAST 
lbi-116-288045-0009 NO I SAID IN A LOW VOICE 
lbi-116-288045-0010 IT WAS AN IDLE MAN AND NOT A GOD 
lbi-116-288045-0011 IN ATHENS A SEA OF LIGHT ACROSS THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR RELIGION WAS DIVINE 
lbi-116-288045-0012 THEY HAD ONLY ONE FAULT AND WROTE MY GOD WHAT WAS THAT

lbi-116-288045-0015 I WHISPERED TO MYSELF WHAT BLASPHEMY 
lbi-116-288045-0016 THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GUIDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT APOLLO RADIANT PRESENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IMMORTAL LINES OF HOMER CONCERNING DIVINE APOLLO 
lbi-116-288045-0017 DO YOU DOUBT HOMER 
lbi-116-288045-0018 I SAID TO HIM HOMER THE INSPIRED BARD 
lbi-116-288045-0019 NO NO APOLLO IS NOT AN IDOL 
lbi-116-288045-0020 HE IS A GOD AND THE SON OF A GOD 
lbi-116-288045-0021 THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INCENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN GORGEOUS VESTMENTS WERE PASSING TO AND FRO BOWING AND KNEELING BEFORE THE VARIOUS LIGHTS AND IMAGES 
lbi-116-288045-0022 OBSERVING MY ANXIETY TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF ALL THIS MY GUIDE TOOK ME ASIDE AND IN A WHISPER TOLD ME THE PEOPLE WERE CELEBRATING THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH THE OTHER BEAUTIFUL SAVIOR JESUS THE SON OF GOD 
lbi-116-288045-0023 FOR YOU ALONE HE SAID WITH A SUGGESTION OF SEVERITY IN HIS VOICE 
lbi-116-288045-0024 THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AN IDLE 
lbi-116-288045-0025 IF YOU WERE TO SEARCH FOR APOLLO AND ALL THE UNIVERSE WOULD NEVER FIND ANYONE ANSWERING TO HIS NAME OR DESCRIPTION 
lbi-116-288045-0026 I WANT TO SEE JESUS I HASTEN TURNING TOWARD HIM 
lbi-116-288045-0027 WILL HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING 
lbi-116-288045-0028 WILL YOU NOT SPEAK TO HIS WORSHIPPERS I ASKED AGAIN

lbi-116-288045-0030 I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QUIVERING WITH EXCITEMENT 
lbi-116-288045-0031 WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VENTURE TO ASK IMPATIENTLY MAKE JUST AS MUCH OF AN IDOL WAS APOLLO 
lbi-116-288045-0032 AND IF A JESUS AS A GOD PROVES HIM A GOD WILL NOT FAIL IN APOLLO MAKES HIM A GOD 
lbi-116-288046-0000 BUT I AM DETERMINED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JESUS BUT ALSO TO COMMUNICATE THE TRUTH TO OTHERS 
lbi-116-288046-0001 BUT THERE'S MORE OF A MORAL TONIC IN THE OPEN AND CANDID DISCUSSION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE HAND AND IN THE MULTITUDE OF PLATITUDES 
lbi-116-288046-0002 I NEVER DELIVER A LECTURE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY YOUR FULL AND FREE EXPRESSION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING AS WORTHY A FINISH 
lbi-116-288046-0003 IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOGMA IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREEDOM 
lbi-116-288046-0004 OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT HE'S NOT BUILD UP IS ANOTHER CRITICISM OF MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE 
lbi-116-288046-0005 NO PREACHER APPROACHES MORE CONSTRUCTED 
lbi-116-288046-0006 CLASPING TRUTH IN JAIL GAG IN THE MOUTH OF THE STUDENT IS THE BUILDING UP AND TEARING DOWN 
lbi-116-288046-0007 WHEN BRUNO LIGHTED A NEW TORTURE INCREASED THE LIFE OF THE WORLD WHO WAS HIS REWARD THE STAKE 
lbi-116-288046-0008 COUNT YOUR RIGHTS POLITICAL RELIGIOUS SOCIAL INTELLECTUAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CONQUERED FOR YOU BUT A PRIEST 
lbi-116-288046-0009 I WISH TO TELL YOU SOMETHING 
lbi-116-288046-0010 THE FIRST LIST BE IMPERSONAL EPITHETS IRREVERENT BLASPHEMER THEY FEAST AND INFIDEL I FLUNG AT HIM AND NOT FROM PITY BUT FROM ENVY 
lbi-116-288046-0011 NOT HAVING THE COURAGE OF THE INDUSTRIAL OR NEIGHBOUR WHO WORKS LIKE A BUSY BEE IN THE WORLD OF MEN AND BOOKS SEARCHING WITH THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW FOR THE REAL BREAD OF LIFE WHEN THE OPEN PAGE BEFORE HIM WITH HIS TEARS PUSH INTO THE WEE HOURS OF THE NIGHT HIS QUEST ANIMATED BY THE FAIREST OF ALL LOVES THE LOVE OF TRUTH WILL EASE OUR OWN INDOLENT CONSCIENCE BY CALLING HIM NAMES 
lbi-116-288047-0000 A MYTH IS A FANCIFUL EXPLANATION OF A GIVEN PHENOMENON 
lbi-116-288047-0001 THE MODERN CRAZE FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASKED QUESTIONS BECAUSE OF AN INBORN DESIRE TO KNOW 
lbi-116-288047-0002 NOW AND THEN THEY CAME CLOSE ENOUGH TO SNAP AT EACH OTHER 
lbi-116-288047-0003 WITH THIS GOES THE PROTO MAN WAS SATISFIED AND HE WAS DEVELOPING INTELLIGENCE REALIZED ITS INADEQUACY SCIENCE WAS BORN AT REALIZATION 
lbi-116-288047-0004 THE MYTH OF A ONE EYED PEOPLE LIVING IN INDIA HAS BEEN REPLACED BY ACCURATE INFORMATION CONCERNING THE HINDUS 
lbi-116-288047-0005 AND THIS IS PRECISELY THE YEAST WHICH NICHOLAS HAD BEEN PUT 
lbi-116-288047-0006 IS JESUS MAMMA 
lbi-116-288047-0007 THERE IS IN MAN A FACULTY FOR FICTION 
lbi-116-288047-0008 EFFACE LESSENING GUESSES 
lbi-116-288047-0009 THIS REFLECTION WHICH INTRODUCES A BILL INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAGINATION CURBED ITS PACE AND SUBDUING ITS RELIGIOUS SPIRIT 
lbi-116-288047-0010 WE FILL THE SPACE ABOUND OVER ETHEL'S SPIRITS FAIRIES GODS AND OTHER INVISIBLE AN AIRY BEINGS 
lbi-116-288047-0011 WE COVET THE RAINBOW WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON 
lbi-116-288047-0012 OUR FATE NOT REALLY BEING TOUCHED THE FIRM GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISCRETION 
lbi-116-288047-0013 SCIENCE WAS NOT BORN TILL MEN AND MATURED 
lbi-116-288047-0014 GROWN UP PEOPLE CREATE SCIENCE 
lbi-116-288047-0015 THE CRADLE IS THE WOMB OF ALL THE FAIRIES IN FACE OF MANKIND 
lbi-116-288047-0016 THE SCHOOL WAS THE BIRTHPLACE OF SCIENCE 
lbi-116-288047-0017 RELIGION OF THE SCIENCE OF THE CHILD 
lbi-116-288047-0018 IN THE DISCUSSION OF THE SUBJECT I APPEAL TO THE MATURE NOT THE CHILD MIND 
lbi-116-288047-0019 AS GOD'S MOUTHPIECE AND NO ONE MAY DISAGREE WITH HIM 
lbi-116-288047-0020 THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TO BE REASONABLE 
lbi-116-288047-0021 LET US PLACE OURSELVES ENTIRELY IN THE HANDS OF THE EVIDENCE 
lbi-116-288047-0022 AS INTELLIGENT BEINGS WHO DESIRED NOWHERE DOES JESUS WHOSE WORSHIP WAS NOT ONLY COSTING THE WORLD MILLIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO JOINED TO HIS SERVICE THE TIME THE ENERGIES THE AFFECTIONS THE DEVOTIONS AND THE LABOR OF HUMANITY IS A MYTH OR REALITY

lbi-3660-172183-0019 AND THEY LEFT THE WOOD AND CAME TO AN OPEN COUNTRY WITH MEADOWS ON ONE HAND AND MOWERS MOWING THE MEADOWS

lbi-3660-6517-0000 THE DATE SEEM UNIMPORTANT BUT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE SHIP HAD BEEN UNREMITTINGLY BUSY 
lbi-3660-6517-0001 BOWS ATTACKED THE SHIP STORES SURVEYED RELEASED AND RESTORED THEM SAVING VERY MUCH SPACE BY AN STOWING NUMEROUS CASES AND STOWING THE CONTENTS IN THE LAZARETTE 
lbi-3660-6517-0002 WITHOUT STEAM THE LEAK NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH A HAND PUMP BY TWO DAILY ALLOWANCE OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES 
lbi-3660-6517-0003 AS THE SHIP WAS AN EVER PRESENT HEAVILY LADEN CONDITION WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE TO FOUR HOURS EACH DAY 
lbi-3660-6517-0004 THE LARGE GREEN TENT WAS PUT UP IN PROPER SUPPORTS MADE FOR IT 
lbi-3660-6517-0005 THE ENGINE ROOM STAFF ANANUS AS PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOWING THEIR LABORATORIES THE COOK REFITTING AS GAILY AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD ITS BAND OF WORKERS 
lbi-3660-6517-0006 THE MAN'S FACE SUCH AS IT IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FOREHATCH THE STEM ON THE MAIN DECK 
lbi-3660-6517-0007 UNDER THE FORECASTLE OR STALLS FIFTEEN PONIES NECKS ON THE SPACE WOULD HOLD THE NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT WAS PACKED TIGHT WITH FODDER 
lbi-3660-6517-0008 NEATLY BEHIND THE FORECASTLE BULKHEAD WAS A SMALL BOOBY HATCH THE OLEANDERS TO THE MEN'S MESS DECK IN BAD WEATHER 
lbi-3660-6517-0009 ABAFT THE FORE HATCH THE ICEHOUSE 
lbi-3660-6517-0010 WE MANAGED TO GET THREE TONS OF ICE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO CARCASSES OF MUTTON AND THREE CARCASES OF BEEF BESIDES SOME BOXES OF SWEETBREADS AND KIDNEYS INTO SPACE 
lbi-3660-6517-0011 THE SACKS CONTAINING THIS LAST ATTITUDE THE GOODS ALREADY MENTIONED MAKE A REALLY HEAVY DECK CARGO AND WAS NATURALLY ANXIOUS CONCERNING IT BUT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY LASHINGS SECURING HAS BEEN DONE 
lbi-3660-6517-0012 FORAGE I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIRTY TONS OF COMPRESSED OATEN HAY FROM MELBOURNE 
lbi-3660-6517-0013 THE SCENE IS WHOLLY ENCHANTING AND SUCH A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER IN A GARDEN WHICH BLAZES WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION WITH ALL THINGS 
lbi-3660-6517-0014 A GREAT MASS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED 
lbi-3660-6517-0015 CAN I LUNCH WITH THE POT IN THE MUSEUM COMPANY SHIP RUBEHO 
lbi-3660-6517-0016 TELEGRAM TO SAY TERRAN OVERHEAD ARISE SUNDAY NIGHT 
lbi-3660-6517-0017 THE THIRD SLEDGE STANDS ACROSS THE BREAK OF THE POOP AND THE SPACE HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY THE AFTER WINCH 
lbi-3660-6517-0018 THE QUANTITY IS TWO AND A HALF TONS AND THE SPACE OCCUPIED CONSIDERABLE 
lbi-3660-6517-0019 THE SHIP WAS OVER TWO FEET BY THE STERN BUT THIS WILL SOON BE REMEDIED 
lbi-3660-6517-0020 THEY MUST PERFORCE BE CHAINED UP AND GIVEN WHAT SHELTER WAS AFFORDED ON DECK BUT THEIR POSITION WAS NOT ENVIABLE 
lbi-3660-6517-0021 IT IS A PATHETIC ATTITUDE DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY CASUALLY SOME POOR BEAST EMITS A LONG PATHETIC ONE 
lbi-3660-6517-0022 THERE ARE GENERALLY ONE OR TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASES MATTERS BUT IT IS A SQUASH 
lbi-3660-6517-0023 LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND HAS VEERED TO THE WESTWARD HITTING US LIGHTLY 
lbi-3660-6517-0024 OATS AND ATKINSON WITH INTERMITTENT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHERS WERE BUSY KEEPING THE PONIES ON THEIR LEGS 
lbi-3660-6517-0025 THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EVIL AND NEARLY ALL HANDS WERE LABOURING FOR HOURS IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP HEAVING COAL SACKS OVERBOARD AND RELAXING THE PETREL CASES ET CETERA IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE AND SUCH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES 
lbi-3660-6517-0026 NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED IN SOME EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY WEIGHT WOULD TEAR AWAY THE LASHING AND THE WORK TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN 
lbi-3660-6517-0027 FROM THIS MOMENT ABOUT FOUR A M THE END ROOM BECAME THE CENTRE OF INTEREST 
lbi-3660-6517-0028 THE WATER GAINED IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT 
lbi-3660-6517-0029 THE OUTLOOK APPEARED GRIM 
lbi-3660-6517-0030 THE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH WAS BEING MADE WITH THE SHIP SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS MOST UNCERTAIN 
lbi-3660-6517-0031 WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW FIRES WHAT WAS TO BE DONE 
lbi-3660-6517-0032 THE BILGE PUMPS DEPENDED ON THE MAIN ENGINE 
lbi-3660-6517-0033 ON ONE OCCASION I WAS WAIST DEEP WHEN STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THE POOP 
lbi-3660-6517-0034 THE AFTERGUARD WERE ORGANIZED INTO PARTIES BY EVANS TO WORK BUCKETS THE MEN WERE KEPT STEADILY GOING ON THE CHOKED AND PUMPS THEY SEEMED ALL THAT COULD BE DONE FOR THE MOMENT AND WHAT I'M EDGED ACCOUNT AS A SOUL SAVED OUT OF THE SHIP FROM SINKING PRACTICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BAIL HER OUT 
lbi-3660-6517-0035 OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD BEAR ONE OF THEM AWAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED BY HIS CHAIN 
lbi-3663-172005-0000 THE FOG HAD TAKEN THIS MORNING MEAL AND NOW LAY CURLED UP ON A BED OF MOSS 
lbi-3663-172005-0001 WHENEVER THE HANCOCK UP HE WAS QUITE CONTENT TO FRISK ABOUT 
lbi-3663-172005-0002 THE ANGEL WAS CERTAIN NOW IT WERE NEAR 
lbi-3663-172005-0003 THE HOUSE HAD STRUCK A TRAIL WHERE SHE TURNED AND LOOKED ON WITH FAVOUR 
lbi-3663-172005-0004 ONE WAS ROLLING THE OTHER HAD A GUN IN HIS HAND WHAT SHOULD SHE DO 
lbi-3663-172005-0005 HER ENTIRE LAKES COULD NOT PROPEL THE QUIET BODY RAPIDLY 
lbi-3663-172005-0006 THE GIRL SAW THE BOAT NEARING HER 
lbi-3663-172005-0007 IN A MOMENT MORE THE BOAT WAS ON HER AND THE MAN AT THE OARS HAD LEANED OVER AND CAUGHT HER 
lbi-3663-172528-0000 I WAS TORMENTED BY THIRST BUT HAD ABSTAINED FROM DRINKING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS 
lbi-3663-172528-0001 THE OLD MAN CEASED TO GIVE SO MUCH ANNOYANCE YET SOMETIMES HE APPEARED TO ME IN DREAMS 
lbi-3663-172528-0002 PHILLIDA HAD GIVEN THEM ORDERS NOT TO SPEAK TO ME OF THIS 
lbi-3663-172528-0003 THIS MAN HAS STOLEN FROM ME CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND IN THE FIELD BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD DIED 
lbi-3663-172528-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE ALLOWED ME TWICE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FOR I THINK OF IT MYSELF AND BEGAN TO SWEAT AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP 
lbi-3663-172528-0005 THE THEORY THAT MY POOR FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO GRIEVED WAS HE TO HEAR THIS 
lbi-3663-172528-0006 AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE SERVING GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIND SHOUTED OUT AH TRAITRESS YOU HAVE KILLED HIM FOR ME THEN 
lbi-3663-172528-0007 SHE MAY INDEED HAVE SAVED MY LIFE SO LEND ME A HELPING HAND FOR I HAVE SWEATED AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT 
lbi-3663-172528-0008 VICI RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS DRIED AND MADE ME COMFORTABLE AND I BECAME CONSCIOUS OF A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN MY STATE BEGAN TO RECKON ON RECOVERY 
lbi-3663-172528-0009 JUST THEN THE OTHER DOCTOR BERNARDINO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAD REFUSED TO BELIEVE ME 
lbi-3663-172528-0010 MAESTRO FRANCESCO THAT MOST ABLE MAN EXCLAIMED O POWER OF NATURE 
lbi-3663-172528-0011 SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE PHYSICIANS KNOW NOTHING 
lbi-3663-172528-0012 THE SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER SAYING IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED UPON THE SPOT 
lbi-3663-172528-0013 AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO ME AND I BELIEVE I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER 
lbi-3663-172528-0014 I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED MY THIRST 
lbi-3663-172528-0015 IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BAD DUE TO BLEED HIM 
lbi-3663-172528-0016 IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE 
lbi-3663-172528-0017 YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HIS SKILL 
lbi-3663-172528-0018 AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED WIGHT SULKILY DEPARTING AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN 
lbi-3663-172528-0019 THE VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN THE CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD 
lbi-3663-172528-0020 DO NOT PERMITTING ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAD ESCAPED THIS TIME AND NEITHER DOES ORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM 
lbi-3663-172528-0021 THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE 
lbi-3663-172528-0022 SO I MADE MY MIND UP AND PREPARE TO TRAVEL 
lbi-3663-172528-0023 THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIERRE LADDIE WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD 
lbi-3663-172528-0024 NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICOLO DE MONG DE UGLY WIDOW WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE 
lbi-3663-172528-0025 I HAD HARBORED HEAVE AND ROLL AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HEAD 
lbi-3663-172528-0026 MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DE MONTEVARCHI ATTENDED TO MY KEEL WITH GREAT SKILL 
lbi-3663-172528-0027 THERE THEY FITTED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY 
lbi-3663-172528-0028 MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DEW 
lbi-3663-172528-0029 AT THESE WORDS MY ASTRAGALUS THEANO THE DUKE'S TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT 
lbi-3663-172528-0030 GEORGE WAS A PAINTER WHOM I HAVE MENTIONED HAPPENED JUST THEN TO PASS AND MY SISTER ALICE THEANO EXCLAIMED THERE IS THE MAN WHO ACCUSED YOU NOW YOU KNOW YOURSELF IF IT BE TRUE OR NOT 
lbi-3663-172528-0031 AS FOR THESE VIEWS I COU'D NOT BEING ABLE TO LEAVE MY FEET I ASKED JOE IF IT WAS TRUE THAT HE HAD ACCUSED ME 
lbi-3663-172528-0032 HE DENIED THAT IT WAS SO AND THAT HE HAD EVER SAID ANYTHING OF THE SORT 
lbi-3663-172528-0033 MY SER AGOSTINO RETORTED YOU GALLOWS BIRD 
lbi-3663-172528-0034 DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW IT WILL MOST CERTAINLY 
lbi-3663-172528-0035 GEORGE WILL MADE OFF AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD REPEATING THAT HE HAD NOT ACCUSED ME 
lbi-3663-172528-0036 THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE THE DUKE CAME BY WHEREUPON I HAD MYSELF RAISED UP BEFORE HIS EXCELLENCY AS HE HALTED 
lbi-3663-172528-0037 THE DUKE GAZED AT ME AND MY BOAT I WAS STILL ALIVE AFTERWARDS BADE ME TAKE HEED TO BE AN HONEST MAN AND REGAIN MY HEALTH 
lbi-3663-172528-0038 WHEN I REACHED HOME NICHOLAS THAT ONE DAY A GOOD TOOL CAME TO VISIT ME AND TOLD ME THAT I HAD ESCAPED ONE OF THE MOST DREADFUL PERILS IN THE WORLD QUITE CONTRARY TO ALL HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR HE HAD SEEN MY RUIN WRITTEN WITH INDELIBLE INK NOW I MUST MAKE HASTE TO GET WELL AND AFTERWARDS TAKE FRENCH LEAVE BECAUSE MY JEOPARDY CAME FROM A QUARTER AND A MAN WHO WAS ABLE TO DESTROY ME 
lbi-3663-172528-0039 I ANSWERED THAT I HAD DONE NOTHING TO DISPLEASE HIM BUT THAT HE HAD INJURED ME AND TOLD HIM ALL THE AFFAIR ABOUT THE MEANS 
lbi-3663-172528-0040 HE REPEATED GET HENCE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN AND BE OF GOOD COURAGE FOR YOU WILL SEE A VENGEANCE EXECUTED SOONER THAN YOU EXPECT 
lbi-3663-172528-0041 AY THE BEST ATTENTION TO MY HEALTH GAVE PIERRE TO BAG A LITTLE ADVICE ABOUT THAT BEING THE POINT AND THEY WENT OFF UPON MY WAY TO ROME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD TO THE DUKE OR ANYBODY ELSE 
lbi-3663-172528-0042 YOU WANT THEM TO IMMORTALIZE THAT FEROCIOUS TYRANT 
lbi-3663-172528-0043 YOU HAVE NEVER MADE ANYTHING SO EXQUISITE WHICH PROVES YOU AN INVETERATE FOE AND THE DEVOTED FRIEND AND YET THE POPE AND HE HATH HAD IT TWICE IN MINE TO HANG YOU WITHOUT ANY FAULT OF YOURS 
lbi-3663-172528-0044 IT WAS FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT DUKE ALESSANDRO WAS THE SON OF POPE CLEMENT 
lbi-3663-172528-0045 MESSER FRANCESCO USED OH SO TO SAY AND SWEAR BY ALL HE THINKS THAT IF HE COULD HE WOULD HAVE ROBBED ME OF THE DYES FLOW THAT MEADOW 
lbi-3663-172528-0046 I RESPONDED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE 
lbi-3663-172528-0047 I NOW SENT TO FLORENCE TO REQUEST LORING THEANO THAT HE WOULD SEND ME THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL 
lbi-3663-172528-0048 NICHOLAS NODDED MONTY GREW DULL TO WHOM I HAD TREATED WROTE BACK SAYING THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO THAT MAD MELANCHOLY PHILOSOPHER LORENZINO FOR IT HE HAD REPLIED THAT HE WAS THINKING NIGHT AND DAY OF NOTHING ELSE AND THAT HE WOULD FINISH IT AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE 
lbi-3663-172528-0049 NEVERTHELESS I WAS NOT TO SET MY HOPES UPON HIS REVERSE BUT I HAD BETTER INVENT ONE OUT OF MY OWN HEAD AND WHEN I HAD FINISHED IT I MIGHT BRING IT WITHOUT HESITATION TO THE DUKE FOR THIS WOULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE 
lbi-3663-172528-0050 I COMPOSED THE DESIGN OF A REVERSE WHICH IT SEEMED TO ME APPROPRIATE AND PRESS THE WORD FORWARD TO MY BEST ABILITY 
lbi-3663-172528-0051 THIS BEING SO IF HE WAS A FELLOW OF MUCH HUMOUR WE USED OFTEN TO LAUGH TOGETHER ABOUT THE GREAT CREDIT HE HAD GAINED 
lbi-3663-172528-0052 I THEREFORE DISMOUNTED AT ONE'S GOT MY FOWLING PIECE READY AND AT A VERY LONG RANGE BROUGHT TWO OF THEM DOWN WITH A SINGLE BALL 
lbi-3663-172528-0053 I NEVER USED TO SHOOT WITH MORE THAN ONE BALL AND WAS USUALLY ABLE TO HEAT MY MARK AT TWO HUNDRED CUBITS WHICH CANNOT BE DONE BY OTHER WAYS OF RELOADING 
lbi-3663-172528-0054 I LIFTED MY FOOT AND LET THE WATER RUN OUT THEN WHEN I HAD MOUNTED WE MAKE HASTE FOR ROME 
lbi-3915-57461-0000 WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN AMASSING TWO HUNDRED OUNCES OF SILVER ENOUGH I TRUST TO ERECT A HANDSOME BRONZE FIGURE 
lbi-3915-57461-0001 TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SHAME YET IF I COULD STEAL THE MONEY THIS PRIESTESS BOASTING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EASE FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CASTING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMPASS HIS PURPOSE 
lbi-3915-57461-0002 BUT THE PRIEST FAR FROM GUESSING THE DRIFT OF HIS COMRADE'S THOUGHTS JOURNEYED CHEERFULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF CUMANA 
lbi-3915-57461-0003 HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSSED IN FERRY BOATS THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASSENGERS ARE GATHERED TOGETHER UNDER ONE OF THESE BOATS THE TWO TRAVELLERS EMBARKED 
lbi-3915-57461-0004 WHEN THE BOATMEN AND PASSENGERS HEARD THE SPLASH AND SAW THE PRIEST STRUGGLING IN THE WATER THEY WERE AFRAID AND MADE EVERY EFFORT TO SAVE HIM BUT THE WIND WAS FAIR AND THE BOAT RUNNING SWIFTLY UNDER THE BELLYING SAILS SO THEY WERE SOON A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OFF FROM THE DROWNING MAN WHO SANK BEFORE THE BOAT COULD BE TURNED TO RESCUE HIM 
lbi-3915-57461-0005 WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RHONE FEIGNED THE UTMOST GRIEF AND DISMAY AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASSENGERS THIS PRIEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY COUSIN HE WAS GOING TO KIOTO TO VISIT THE SHRINE OF HIS PATRON AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SETTLED TO TRAVEL TOGETHER 
lbi-3915-57461-0006 NOW AT LAST BY THIS MISFORTUNE MY COUSIN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE 
lbi-3915-57461-0007 HE SPOKE SO FEELINGLY AND WEPT SO FREELY THAT THE PASSENGERS BELIEVED HIS STORY AND PITIED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM 
lbi-3915-57461-0008 THEN IT SAID TO THE BOATMAN 
lbi-3915-57461-0009 WHAT THINK YOU GENTLEMEN ADDED HE TURNING TO THE OTHER TRAVELLERS 
lbi-3915-57461-0010 THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AVOID ANY HINDRANCE TO THEIR ONWARD JOURNEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AGREED TO WHAT THE RONIN HAD PROPOSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SETTLED 
lbi-3915-57461-0011 WHEN AT LENGTH THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY LEFT THE BOAT AND EVERY MAN WENT HIS WAY BUT THE RONIN OVERJOYED IN HIS HEART TOOK THE WANDERING PRIEST'S LUGGAGE AND PUTTING IT WITH HIS OWN PURSUED HIS JOURNEY TO KIOTA 
lbi-3915-57461-0012 FORTUNE FAVOURING HIS SPECULATIONS HE BEGAN TO AMASS GREAT WEALTH AND LIVED AT HIS EASE DENYING HIMSELF NOTHING AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME HE MARRIED A WIFE WHO BORE HIM A CHILD 
lbi-3915-57461-0013 SINCE THEN ALL HAS GONE WELL WITH ME YET HAD I NOT BEEN POOR I HAD NEVER TURNED ASSASSIN NOR THIEF 
lbi-3915-57461-0014 HE WOULD HAVE FLED INTO THE HOUSE BUT THE GHOST STRETCHED FORTH ITS WITHERED ARM AND CLUTCHING THE BACK OF HIS NECK SCOWLED AT HIM WITH A VINDICTIVE GLARE AND A HIDEOUS GHASTLINESS OF MIEN SO UNSPEAKABLY AWFUL THAT ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE SWOONED WITH FEAR 
lbi-3915-57461-0015 AT LENGTH AN DONE BY SUCH CEASELESS VEXATION TOOK OBEY FELL ILL AND KEPT MUTTERING OH MISERY MISERY THE WANDERING PRIEST IS COMING TO TORTURE ME 
lbi-3915-57461-0016 NOW IT CHANCED THAT THE STORY REACHED THE EARS OF A CERTAIN WANDERING PRIEST WHO LODGED IN THE NEXT STREET 
lbi-3915-57461-0017 AND HIDING HIS HEAD UNDER THE COVER LET HE LAY QUIVERING ALL OVER 
lbi-3915-57461-0018 THREE YEARS AGO AT THE COUP ON A FAIRY YOU FLUNG ME INTO THE WATER AND WELL YOU REMEMBER IT 
lbi-3915-57461-0019 HAPPILY CONTINUED THE PRIEST I HAD LEARNED TO SWIM AND TO DIVE AS A BOY SO I REACHED THE SHORE AND AFTER WANDERING THROUGH MANY PROVINCES SUCCEEDED IN SETTING UP A BRONZE FIGURE TO BUDDHA THUS FULFILLING THE WISH OF MY HEART 
lbi-3915-57461-0020 ON MY JOURNEY HOMEWARD I TOOK A LODGING IN THE NEXT STREET AND THERE HEARD OF YOUR MARVELLOUS AILMENT 
lbi-3915-57461-0021 THINKING I COULD DIVINE ITS CAUSE I CAME TO SEE YOU AND AM GLAD TO FIND I WAS NOT MISTAKEN 
lbi-3915-57461-0022 AND WOULD IT NOT ILL BECOME ME TO BEAR MALICE 
lbi-3915-57461-0023 REPENT THEREFORE AND ABANDON YOUR EVIL WAYS 
lbi-3915-57461-0024 TO SEE YOU DO SO I SHOULD ESTEEM THE HEIGHT OF HAPPINESS 
lbi-3915-57461-0025 BE OF GOOD CHEER NOW AND LOOK ME IN THE FACE AND YOU WILL SEE THAT I AM REALLY A LIVING MAN AND NO VENGEFUL GOBLIN COME TO TORMENT YOU 
lbi-3915-57461-0026 IN A FIT OF MADNESS I WAS TEMPTED TO KILL AND ROB YOU 
lbi-3915-57461-0027 FORTUNE BEFRIENDED ME EVER AFTER BUT THE RICHER I GREW THE MORE KEENLY I FELT HOW WICKED I HAD BEEN AND THE MORE I FORESAW THAT MY VICTIM'S VENGEANCE WOULD SOME DAY OVERTAKE ME 
lbi-3915-57461-0028 HAUNTED BY THIS THOUGHT I LOST MY NERVE TILL ONE NIGHT I BEHELD YOUR SPIRIT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH FELL ILL 
lbi-3915-57461-0029 BUT HOW YOU MANAGED TO ESCAPE AND ARE STILL ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND 
lbi-3915-57461-0030 A GUILTY MAN SAID THE PRIEST WITH A SMILE SHUDDERS AT THE RUSTLING OF THE WIND OR THE CHATTERING OF HISTORIC SPEAK A MURDERER'S CONSCIENCE PREYS UPON HIS MIND TILL HE SEES WHAT IS NOT 
lbi-3915-98647-0000 EVERY WELL ORDERED CAPTAINS HOME OF THE OLD FASHIONED PARLOR HAS ITS LITTLE SHRINE WHICH IS THE CENTRE OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE HOUSE 
lbi-3915-98647-0001 SHINGLES WHO SETS THE RICE AND WINE BEFORE THE ANCESTRAL CLOUDLETS WHO LIGHTS THE LAMP EACH NIGHT AND WHO SEES THAT AT EACH FEAST AN ANNIVERSARY SEASON THE PROPER FOOD IS PREPARED AND SET OUT FOR THE HOUSEHOLD GODS 
lbi-3915-98647-0002 THESE MUST BE KEPT CAREFULLY BY THE LIBERALS A SAFE GUARD AGAINST THE MANY EVILS THAT BESET CHILD LIFE 
lbi-3915-98647-0003 THIS IS DENOTED TEMPLES BY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS OFTEN RESULT IN ADDITION TO THE CHILD'S COLLECTION 
lbi-3915-98647-0004 ALL THESE ARE PUT TOGETHER BY THE CAREFUL MOTHER PRESERVED AS JEALOUSLY AS QUEEN ALTHEA KEPT THE CHARRED STICK THAT GOVERNED THE DESTINIES OF HER SON 
lbi-3915-98647-0005 AS THE CHILDREN ARRIVE AT YEARS OF DISCRETION THESE TREASURES PASS OUT OF THE MOTHER'S FAITHFUL KEEPING INTO THE HANDS OF THEIR ACTUAL OWNERS AND THEIR YEARLY KEPT STORED AWAY IN SOME LITTLE USED DRAWER CABINET UNTIL DEATH REMOVED THE NECESSITY FOR ANY FURTHER SAFEGUARDS OVER LIFE 
lbi-3915-98647-0006 EACH ANIMAL BRINGS ITS OWN KIND OF GOOD OR BAD LUCK TO THE HOUR DAY OR YEAR OVER WHICH PROVIDES ONLY A SKILFUL BALANCER PROS AND CONS CAN READ OR WRITE THE COMBINATIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE LUCK OF ANY PARTICULAR HOUR IN ANY PARTICULAR DAY OF ANY PARTICULAR WILL BE 
lbi-3915-98647-0007 THE GREATER EVENTS OF FAMILY LIFE WHOSE PROPHECIES ARE FELT TO BE TOO UNCERTAIN RELIGIOUS SERVICES OF THE FORTUNE TELLER MUST BE CALLED ONE 
lbi-3915-98647-0008 NO WELL MANAGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILDING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FINDING WHAT DIRECTION TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR 
lbi-3915-98647-0009 AFTER THIS MATTER HAS BEEN SETTLED IN THE HOUSE IS FAIRLY BEGUN THERE ARE OCCASIONAL CRISES AND ITS CONSTRUCTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEPENDS 
lbi-3915-98647-0010 OF THESE THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS THE DAY WHEN THE ROOF IS RAISED 
lbi-3915-98647-0011 A HOUSE OWNER THEN DECIDE WHETHER THEY SAT BY THE BUILDERS A LUCKY ONE FOR HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY 
lbi-3915-98647-0012 A PRESENT OF MONEY TO EACH WORKMAN IS ALSO AN ORDER AND WILL CONDUCE TO THE RAPID AND FAITHFUL EXECUTION OF THE JOB AND WHEN AT LAST THE HOUSES FINANCED AND CARPENTERS AND PLASTERERS WERE READY TO LEAVE AT THE LOCAL IRISHMEN WHO HAVE ASSISTED ALL ALONG THE BUILDING AS UNSKILLED LABOURERS OFTEN ASCENDED TO THE ROOF AND FROM THE RIDGE POLE CAST DOWN CAKES FOR WHICH THE CHILDREN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCRAMBLED JOYFULLY 
lbi-3915-98647-0013 OH COME WHO CAN AND THOSE WHO CANNOT COME SOME SERVANTS OR PROVISIONS 
lbi-3915-98647-0014 ON THE DAY AFTER THAT DEATH OFTEN IN THE EVENING THE BODY MUST BE PLACED IN A CASK SHAPED COFFIN THAT UNTIL RECENTLY WAS A STYLE COMMONLY IN USE IN JAPAN 
lbi-3915-98647-0015 NOW AMONG THE WEALTHIER CLASSES THE LONG COFFIN HAS SUPERSEDED THE SMALL SQUARE OR ROUND ONE OF THE SMALLER EXPENSE CONNECTED WITH THE BURIAL IN THE OLD WAY MAKES A SURVIVAL OF AN OLD TIME A NECESSITY FOR THE MAJORITY OF JAPANESE 
lbi-3915-98647-0016 AT AN APPOINTED TIME ALL THE RELATIVES ASSEMBLE IN THE DEATH CHAMBER AND PREPARATIONS ARE MADE FOR THE BATHING OF THE CORPSE 
lbi-3915-98647-0017 HERE'S NO OFFICIAL CEREMONIAL MOURNING OF PARENTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN NOR DOES CUSTOM REQUIRE THEM TO PERFORM ANY OF THE LAST RITES OR ATTEND THE FUNERAL 
lbi-3915-98647-0018 UPON THE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS FALLS THE DUTY OF ATTENDING TO ALL THE LAST ADMINISTRATIONS 
lbi-3915-98647-0019 WHEN THE BODY HAS BEEN WASHED AND DRESSED IN WHITE AND SILK HABIT WHENEVER THE FAMILY CAN AFFORD IT 
lbi-3915-98647-0020 THE BODY TO BE PLACED IN THE COFFIN MUST BE FOLDED INTO A SITTING POSTURE AND THE CHIN RESTING UPON THE KNEES THE POSITION OF THE MUMMIES FOUND IN MANY ABORIGINAL AMERICAN THAMES 
lbi-3915-98647-0021 THIS DIFFICULT TO US APPARENTLY IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED THERE ARE PLACED IN THE COFFIN A NUMBER OF SMALL THINGS FOR THE DEAD TAKES WITH HIM TO THE NEXT WORLD 
lbi-3915-98647-0022 THE SINGLE EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE ABOUT NATAL IS THAT SMALL COPPER COINS MAY BE PUT IN TO FEED THE OLD HAG WHO GUARDS THE BANK OF THE RIVER OF DEATH 
lbi-3915-98647-0023 LAST OF ALL THE VACANT SPACES IN THE COFFIN ARE FILLED IN WITH BASKETS OF TEA 
lbi-3915-98647-0024 SO LONG AS THE COFFIN WAS IN THE HOUSE IT MUST BE WATCHED OVER CONTINUALLY 
lbi-3915-98647-0025 IT IS THEIR DUTY TO SEE THAT THE INCENSE BURNING BEFORE THE COFFIN IS NEVER ALLOWED TO GO OUT WHILE THE FOOD FOR THE DEAD IS RENEWED AT REGULAR INTERVALS BY THE MOURNERS THEMSELVES 
lbi-3915-98647-0026 THERE ARE FEW ENLIGHTENED JAPANESE WHO WILL DEFEND THE PRESENT SYSTEM OF CRUELTY TO THE AFFLICTED OR WHO DO NOT LONG FOR SOME CHANGE BUT SO GREAT IS THE FORCE OF CONSERVATISM IN THIS REGARD SO HAUNTING FEAR THAT ANY CHANGE MAY INDICATE A LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE DEAD EVER FORM ADVANCES SLOWLY 
lbi-3915-98647-0027 INDIVIDUAL INSTANCES OCCUR IN WHICH SOME OF THE WORST FEATURES OF THESE CUSTOMS ARE MODIFIED 
lbi-3915-98647-0028 A CASE IN POINT IS THAT OF THE LATE MISTER FOCUS TO A MAN WHOSE LIFE IS DEVOTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS COUNTRYMEN AND MODERN WAYS AND WHO IN HIS DEATH CONTINUED HIS TEACHING 
lbi-3915-98647-0029 AND IT'S WELL HE PROVIDED THAT HIS BODY WAS TO BE BURIED WITHOUT WASHING AND THE CLOTHING IN WHICH HE DIED 
lbi-3915-98647-0030 THROUGH THIS GROWING FEELING IN THE UNSELFISHNESS OF MATERNAL AFFECTION MAY COME IN TIME THEIR RELEASE FROM THESE MOURNFUL CEREMONIES 
lbi-3915-98647-0031 JUST BEFORE THE PROCESSION STARTS A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IS HELD AT THE HOUSE WHICH WAS ATTENDED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE DECEASED AND WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT PERFORMED AT THE CEMETERY 
lbi-3915-98647-0032 ON THE DAY OF THE BURIAL GREAT BUNCHES OF NATURAL FLOWERS OR SENTIMENT THAT EACH BUNCH SO LARGE AS TO REQUIRE THE SERVICES OF ONE MAN TO CARRY 
lbi-3915-98647-0033 SOMETIMES WITH A GIFT A MAN IS SENT TO TAKE PART IN THE PROCESSION BUT IF THE GIVER FEELS TOO POOR TO HIRE A MAN THIS BURDEN TO FALLS UPON THE BEREAVED HOUSEHOLD FOR ETIQUETTE REQUIRED THAT ALL FLOWERS SENT BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE BY UNIFORMED COOLIES WHO MARCHED IN THE FUNERAL TRAIN 
lbi-3915-98647-0034 ANOTHER FAVORITE PRESENT AT THIS TIME AMONG BUDDHISTS IS A CAGE OF LIVING BIRDS TO BE BORNE TO THE GRAVE AND RELEASED ON 
lbi-3915-98647-0035 IT SEEMED MORE LIKE A BRIDLE THAN A BURIAL 
lbi-3915-98647-0036 DURING THIS PERIOD THE SPIRIT OF THE DECEASED WAS SUPPOSED TO BE STILL INHABITING THE HOUSE AND A TABLET OR SHRINE IS SET UP IN THE DEATH CHAMBER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLOWERS ARE RENEWED DAILY 
lbi-4153-185072-0000 HE DOUBTED AGAIN ASHORE A FEW DAYS AND CAME UP TO GOD'S WILL THAT I THEN RESIDED HE WAS APPARENTLY WITHOUT ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT HE SOON BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY SON THOMAS WITH WHOM HE HUNTED FOR A LONG TIME AND MADE HIS HOME WITH HIM AT MY HOUSE RENT AGAIN AND HE CONTINUED HIS DAY 
lbi-4153-185072-0001 THE ENRAGED HUSBAND THAN THAT HE SHOULD FEEL OBLIGED IF HE WAITED TO HEAR THE ORDER REPEATED INSTANTLY REPEATED AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS CAPTAIN 
lbi-4153-185072-0002 WE PROTECTED THE POOR MONTICLE WOMAN AND GAVE HER VICTUALS AN ADAM SYMPATHIZED WITH HER IN HER MISFORTUNES DISPLAYING WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME TO HER ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORM OF ADDRESS AND THAT HE HAD ABUSED HER WITHOUT A CAUSE PROMISED A DEFAMATION AND SHE RECEIVED HIM WITH EVERY MARK OF A RENEWAL OF HER AFFECTION 
lbi-4153-185072-0003 THE INDIANS WERE SOON ANSWERED BY THE AMERICAN OFFICER THAT WAMPUM WAS CORDIALLY ACCEPTED AND THAT A CONTINUANCE OF PEACE WAS ARDENTLY WISHED FOR 
lbi-4153-185072-0004 MY SON THOMAS WENT WITH THEM WITH ISLANDS HORSE I'M GOING TO QUIT 
lbi-4153-185072-0005 IVAN ON FINDING THAT HIS ENEMIES HAD GONE CAME BACK TO MY HOUSE WHERE HE LIVED AS BEFORE BUT ALL HIS BURDEN WAS SOON NOTIFIED AT NIAGARA AND NETTA'S WHO MARRIED MISS LAMB C WITH A SMALL BODY OF INDIANS CAME ON TO TAKE HIM 
lbi-4153-185072-0006 NETTA'S AT LENGTH ABANDONED THE CHASE WENT HOME AND ADDED AN URGENT LETTERS CAME IN 
lbi-4153-185072-0007 BY LIVING IN THE WOODS HIS CLOTHING HAD BECOME TORN INTO RAGS TO LEVY WITH A SOFTENING CONDITION ALMOST NAKED 
lbi-4153-185072-0008 ALAN MADE HIS TOWZLED HIMSELF AND THEN BIT ALOFT ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MONT MAUDIT 
lbi-4153-185072-0009 THERE AN INDIAN GIVE HIM SOME REFRESHMENT AND A GOOD GUN WITH WHICH HE HASTENED ON LIQUID BEARDSTOWN BUT HE FOUND HIS CALL 
lbi-4153-185072-0010 NOT DARING TO RISK HIMSELF AT THAT PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GOD'S WILL 
lbi-4153-185072-0011 THE LOVE OF LIBERTY HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SWIFTNESS GAVE HIM SUFFICIENT STRENGTH TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE TO HIS FORMER CAUSES OF SAFETY 
lbi-4153-185072-0012 HIS BUST WAS CAME IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE WHERE THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRETLY AND UNDER MY PROTECTION 
lbi-4153-185072-0013 STILL UNSATISFIED AND DOUBTING MY VERACITY THE ADVICE MY INDIAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFLUENCE TO DRAW FROM ME THE SECRET OF HIS CONCEALMENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDER OF GREAT IMPORTANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT MYSELF I PERSISTED IN MY IGNORANCE OF HIS SITUATION AND FINALLY THEY LEFT ME 
lbi-4153-185072-0014 HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AWOKE ME WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION SHOWING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEMIES MIGHT BE WATCHING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN HAVING A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESCAPE 
lbi-4153-185072-0015 AT THAT TIME ISLAND LAY IN A SECRET PLACE IN THE GRASS A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FLAT IN A WHOLE LOT HE ACCIDENTALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER 
lbi-4153-186222-0000 THERE IS LITTLE DANGER IN THIS QUARTER I'M SURE SO I MAY AS WELL HAVE REASONED WITH A CHILD 
lbi-4153-186222-0001 AH WHY NOT

lbi-4153-186222-0003 THE LETTER ASKING ME TO VISIT HER WAS THE FIRST I HAVE EVER RECEIVED FROM HER 
lbi-4153-186222-0004 BUT SINCE SHE ASKED ME TO VISIT HER WE JUDGE SHOULD SOFTEN AND MIGHT WISH TO BECOME FRIENDLY AND SO ACCEPTED THE INVITATION 
lbi-4153-186222-0005 SURELY A GIRL WHO'LL HAVE A BETTER VIANDS OR MORE VOICES THAN ONE COULD HAVE KNOWN

lbi-4153-186222-0012 MY FATHER TEACHES MUSIC AND MOTHERS HOLD HIM CONTINUALLY FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO EARN ENOUGH MONEY TO KEEP OUT OF DEBT 
lbi-4153-186222-0013 WE'VE NEVER SEEN A CENT OF MONEY ALTHOUGH FATHER HAS TRIED AT TIMES TO WARM ENOUGH TO HAPPEN OUT OF HIS DIFFICULTIES 
lbi-4153-186222-0014 I WOULD KISS HER AND SHE AS A NEEDLE AND IT SENT A SHIVER DOWN MY BACK 
lbi-4153-186222-0015 FOR MY PART I AM FOND OF EVERYONE AND IT DELIGHTS ME TO FASTEN ON INVALIDS AND ASSIST THEM

lbi-4153-186222-0034 I MUST SEE THAT ALBANY IS THE ONE WHO DEFIES ME AND REFUSES TO ANSWER MY SECOND NEDDA 
lbi-4153-186222-0035 THERE WILL BE A DOZEN AS THE FIGHT FOR MY MONEY AND DEAR ORLANDO HAS RESORT TO STRANGERS SHE RESUMED THE BITTEN 
lbi-4153-186223-0000 IN ONE CORNER OF THE DUNGEON ROOM KENNETH FORBES SQUATTED UPON A BENCH WITH AN EMPTY BOX HELD CARELESSLY IN HIS CHAIR 
lbi-4153-186223-0001 WHY DUNCAN LOOKED THE BOY WAS BUSY WITH HIS PENCIL BUT NEITHER HAD SPOKEN FOR IF HE'S A HA 
lbi-4153-186223-0002 THEN RIDING SLOWLY UP THE HEDGE BORDERED ROAD HIS CABOOSE ONCE MORE ASSAILED HIM AND HE WONDERED IF THERE WAS NOT SOME ONE BROUGHT UP TO IT HE COULD LIVE RETIRED UNDER THE GODS HAD LEFT AND MUST BE GOOD 
lbi-4153-186223-0003 NORA ASIDE AND HE LOOKED UP TO DISCOVER THAT HE HAD NEARLY RUN DOWN A PEDESTRIAN A STOUT LITTLE MAN WITH A BUNDLE UNDER HIS ARM WHO HELD UP ONE HAND AS IF TO ARREST HIM 
lbi-4153-186223-0004 READY WONDERFUL OFF THE BOY 
lbi-4153-186223-0005 THAT IS THE SAME GAME AS EVER HE RESPONDED WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD 
lbi-4153-186223-0006 DO YOU KNOW I THOUGHT A WHOLE SHEEP DEFORMED AND I'D BE GLAD TO SEE HER AGAIN THAT IRISH YOU'VE GOT MONEY 
lbi-4153-186223-0007 AUNT JANE'S RICH AUNT JANE 
lbi-4153-186223-0008 ECHOED THE MAN QUICKLY WHAT YOU NAME THAT 
lbi-4153-186223-0009 I DON'T LIKE GOOD 
lbi-4153-186223-0010 ANOTHER LONG WAS THEN THE BOY SUDDENLY DONE GRETNA 
lbi-4153-186223-0011 YOU KNOW AN A MIMETIC SUH 
lbi-4153-186223-0012 I USED TO WHEN WE WERE BOTH YOUNGER 
lbi-4153-186223-0013 GIVE IT UP SHARP AND THE MASSED UP A CLERGYMAN WITH A WHIMSICAL SMILE AT THE BOY'S ASTONISHMENT WAS USED UP 
lbi-4153-186223-0014 JOHN MEDIC BUT ME 
lbi-4153-186223-0015 YOU WERE THE INSTRUMENT 
lbi-4153-186223-0016 THE CRACKER HE SUDDENLY BECAME RICH AND A GREAT LADY AND BOWED WITH A SURPRISING THING TO HAVE A DRAMATIC 
lbi-4153-186223-0017 THANK YOU LAD BUT ON THE MAN GRATEFULLY I THOUGHT A LITTLE EXERCISE WOULD DO ME GOOD BUT THIS TIME I HAVE SEEN LIKE BODY DUMMY 
lbi-4153-186223-0018 I DO SAID THE MAN 
lbi-4153-186223-0019 THE BOY TURNED AWAY BUT IN A MOMENT WHY DID AGAIN 
lbi-4153-186223-0020 HIS INTEREST IN MISS JANE'S BROTHER JOHN WAS EXTRAORDINARY 
lbi-4153-61735-0000 THEY ARE BUT LUKEWARM LOVERS WHO CAN CONTENT THEMSELVES WITH THE DIALOGUE CARRIED ON A BOWSHOT DISTANCE 
lbi-4153-61735-0001 IF THE BEE ANALYSING A MONTH IT IS THIS 
lbi-4153-61735-0002 HIS OWN DOCTAH HE'S ONLY DAUGHTER OF THE BEST BLOOD OF SOUTHERN AND EASTERN CHRISSIE BEAUTIFUL ACCOMPLISHED EVERYTHING TO SECURE HIM A SPLENDID ALLIANCE HOLDING NIGHTLY ASSIGNATIONS WITH A HORSE HUNT 
lbi-4153-61735-0003 HE COULD BEAR TO CONCEDE SO MUCH TO HER CAPRICE SINCE HER STAYING AT HOME COULD BE NO DISADVANTAGE TO THE CAUSE THAT HAD PROMPTED HIM TO THE STILL UNCONSCIOUS 
lbi-4153-61735-0004 IT IS ALREADY KNOWN THAT THIS WOULD BOSS THE HACIENDA OF GOD WILL AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER 
lbi-4153-61735-0005 ON REACHING THE CORPSE HE DISMOUNTED LED HIS HORSE IN AMONG THE UNDERWOOD HITCHED HIM BY LOOPING HIS BRIDLE REIN ALONG THE DAMP MOSS TWIGS OF AN ELASTIC BALL THEN ATTACHING A LONG ROPE OF TWISTED HORSEHAIR FROM THE HORN OF HIS SADDLE AND INSERTING HIS ARM INTO ITS QUIET HE GLIDED OUT TO THE EDGE OF THE ISLAND ON THAT SIDE THAT LEAD TOWARDS THE HACIENDA 
lbi-4153-61735-0006 BEFORE FORSAKING THE SHADOW OF THE CORPSE HE CAST A GLANCE TOWARD THE SKY AND THE MOON SAILING SUPREMELY OVER IT 
lbi-4153-61735-0007 THE DROLL CONCEIT WHICH HAS SO OFTEN AMUSED THE KNOCK DOWN AN INEBRIATE OF GREAT CITIES APPEARED TO PRODUCE A LIKE EFFECT UPON THE NIGHT PATROLLING OF THE FAMILY AND FOR A MOMENT THE SHADOW THAT DARKENING HIS BROW DISAPPEARED 
lbi-4153-61735-0008 IT'S NOT LIKELY AT ALL UNLESS IT BE THE OWNER OF A BAD CONSCIENCE WHO CAN SLEEP 
lbi-4153-61735-0009 TROTH THERE'S ONE SUCH WITHIN THOSE WALLS 
lbi-4153-61735-0010 IF HE BE ABROAD THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF HIS SEEING ME OPEN GROUND NOT THAT I SHOULD GET A STRAW IF IT WERE ONLY MYSELF TO BE COMPROMISED 
lbi-4153-61735-0011 IT'S NO USE WAITING UPON THE MOON JUST ECHO 
lbi-4153-61735-0012 IT IS TRUE HE HAD DESIGNS UPON THE HACIENDA BUT THESE DID NOT CONTEMPLATE EITHER ITS GASH FLEET OR JEWELRY IF WE EXCEPT THE MOST PRECIOUS JEWELS IT CONTAINED THE MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HERSELF 
lbi-4323-13259-0000 THE CHURCH BELLS WERE RINGING AND PEOPLE ON THE AVENUE GOING NIGHT SERVICE TURNED CURIOUS INQUIRING LOOKS UP AT THE GREAT HOUSE AND THEN WENT ON TALKING OF THE RECENT EVENTS WHICH HAD SO STRANGELY ENTERED INTO AND MADE HISTORY IN THE CITY 
lbi-4323-13259-0001 AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMPASSIONED APPEAL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOTE OF SADNESS AND REBUKE AND STERN CONDEMNATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEMBERS PALE WITH SELF ACCUSATION OR WITH INWARD ANGER 
lbi-4323-13259-0002 RAYMOND HAD VOTED TO CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SULTAN 
lbi-4323-13259-0003 THE CHRISTIANS OF RAYMOND STOOD CONDEMNED BY THE RESULT 
lbi-4323-13259-0004 FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT AND REIGNED FOR YEARS A SALOON RULED 
lbi-4323-13259-0005 PRESIDENT MARSH THAT ERE HIS USUAL ERECT HANDSOME FROM BRIGHT SELF CONFIDENT BEARING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BOWED UPON HIS BREAST THE GREAT TEARS ROLLING DOWN HIS CHEEKS UNMINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOWN OUTWARD EMOTION IN A PUBLIC SERVICE 
lbi-4323-13259-0006 WHAT IF HE HAD BEGUN TO DO AS JESUS WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO 
lbi-4323-13259-0007 WHEN THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISMAL TEARS 
lbi-4323-13259-0008 WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REGULAR PRECISE CONVENTIONAL ORDER OF SERVICE UNDISTURBED BY ANY VULGAR EMOTION AND UNMOVED BY ANY FOOLISH EXCITEMENT 
lbi-4323-13259-0009 THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SURFACE FEELING THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOTTEN THE DEEP WELLS OF LIGHT 
lbi-4323-13259-0010 THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVED TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER AND RAYMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOREVER 
lbi-4323-13259-0011 SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS KNEW THE DIFFERENT MEETINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS 
lbi-4323-13259-0012 AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE AND THE SALOON AND ITS AWFUL CURSE 
lbi-4323-13259-0013 GRAY AND HIS WIFE ARE BESIEGED BY INQUIRERS WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LORING'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO IN PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER 
lbi-4323-13259-0014 GRAY HAD GONE UP TO VIRGINIA AND AFTER TALKING IT OVER WITH HER OWN MAXIMA E ARRANGEMENT HAD BEEN MADE 
lbi-4323-13259-0015 I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPPOSED TO LARGE PUBLIC FUNERAL SAID GRAY WHOSE COMPLETE WHOLESOME SIMPLICITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREATEST SOURCES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREATURES WHO KNEW THE RAIN WAS SO EARNEST THAT I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO REFUSE THE DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HONOUR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MAXWELL 
lbi-4323-13259-0016 I WILL BE GUIDED BY YOUR JUDGMENT IN THE MATTER 
lbi-4323-13259-0017 I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MIS PAGE THINK BEST WILL BE RIGHT 
lbi-4323-13259-0018 UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I HAVE A GREAT DISTASTE FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DISPLAY AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT 
lbi-4323-13259-0019 IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THE RAIN AND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION AND NEIGHBORING CITY 
lbi-4323-13259-0020 SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES AT THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN 
lbi-4323-13259-0021 IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES ARE CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS 
lbi-4323-13259-0022 MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE 
lbi-4323-13259-0023 RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN IN THE CENTRE OF THE GREAT PACKING INTEREST FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SILENCE 
lbi-4323-13259-0024 THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUEER PART OF THE STRANGE SERVICE 
lbi-4323-13259-0025 IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED 
lbi-4323-13259-0026 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE LINEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONVERTED AT THE MEETINGS JUST RECENTLY 
lbi-4323-18416-0000 THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND AFTER ONE OR TWO INEFFECTUAL ATTEMPTS ROUNDLY TURNED FEARFULLY AWAY 
lbi-4323-18416-0001 I'LL TRY AND SHE LAID A QUICK HAND ON NOW 
lbi-4323-18416-0002 TWO RED SPOTS BURNED ON HER CHEEKS AND HER PALE BLUE EYES SNAPPED

lbi-4323-18416-0019 GRANDPA SAID PHRONSIE WASN'T MISSUS CHATTERTON AUNT CHARLOTTE 
lbi-4323-18416-0020 IF MISSUS CHATTERTON WAS AUNT CHARLOTTE PERSISTED JONESY SLOWLY IT SEEMS AS IF CHARLOTTE OUGHT TO HAVE SOME OF THE MONEY IT REALLY DOES GRANDPAPA

lbi-4323-55228-0000 THE NEXT MOMENT HE FELL BACK IN AMAZEMENT BEFORE THE IMPETUOUS RUSH OF A STARRY EYED FLUSH CHEEKED YOUNG WOMAN WHO DEMANDED 
lbi-4323-55228-0001 WHERE IS C PETE MISS BILLY GASPED THE OLD MAN

lbi-4323-55228-0013 DARLING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY 
lbi-4323-55228-0014 IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GRAY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AND HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE 
lbi-4323-55228-0015 THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED AND ALL 
lbi-4323-55228-0016 AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USABLE

lbi-4323-55228-0025 AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM 
lbi-4323-55228-0026 HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS 
lbi-4323-55228-0027 BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM RETURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT'S 
lbi-4323-55228-0028 AFTER A MINUTE BILLY STIRRED AND SIGHED HAPPILY

lbi-4323-55228-0043 THE TENDER GLOW ON BILLY'S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BERTRAM'S EAGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT 
lbi-4323-55228-0044 SWEETHEART SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFTLY TIGHTENING HIS GOOD LEFT ARM 
lbi-4323-55228-0045 BILLY MY DEAR 
lbi-4323-55228-0046 IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER 
lbi-4323-55228-0047 WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU 
lbi-4323-55228-0048 YOU MEAN IT'LL BE BEFORE OCTOBER

lbi-4323-55228-0050 YES NODDED BILLY DEMURELY 
lbi-4323-55228-0051 YES I KNOW THAT AS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BERTRAM AIRILY 
lbi-4323-55228-0052 WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW 
lbi-4515-11057-0000 YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH 
lbi-4515-11057-0001 A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFIL 
lbi-4515-11057-0002 TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES 
lbi-4515-11057-0003 BECAUSE IN HIS SETTLED DIES HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHUMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THE REAL ATTACHMENT 
lbi-4515-11057-0004 I'VE BEEN ABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK 
lbi-4515-11057-0005 HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY A FAITHFUL BY MARION WHO WAS FIGHTING INSTRUMENT 
lbi-4515-11057-0006 HE WROTE TO MARIAN 
lbi-4515-11057-0007 WILL YOU LET ME HEAR O HEAVENS SEEMING 
lbi-4515-11057-0008 I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFEN'S LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF 
lbi-4515-11057-0009 BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO OVER BY HEALTHY 
lbi-4515-11057-0010 I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS 
lbi-4515-11057-0011 POVERTY I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE 
lbi-4515-11057-0012 BUT OUR LITTLE SEQUEL I HADN'T COME ACROSS BEFORE FOR A LONG TIME 
lbi-4515-11057-0013 WAS HE STILL SO VERY POOR 
lbi-4515-11057-0014 ASKED AMY COMPASSIONATELY 
lbi-4515-11057-0015 I'M AFRAID SIR HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY 
lbi-4515-11057-0016 OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP YOU 
lbi-4515-11057-0017 PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE 
lbi-4515-11057-0018 HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT 
lbi-4515-11057-0019 HAVING THIS OBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT TO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD HAVE A CHOICE OF BEING THE CASE 
lbi-4515-11057-0020 I MEAN TO TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN 
lbi-4515-11057-0021 ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS 
lbi-4515-11057-0022 IS IT SO SERIOUS 
lbi-4515-11057-0023 EVEN IF MISTER HUGH RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE 
lbi-4515-11057-0024 AND DIFFICULTIES A SMOTHERED CRY OF THAT 
lbi-4515-11057-0025 HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FILE DESPONDENTLY 
lbi-4515-11057-0026 I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND AT HOME NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY BE A CHIEF 
lbi-4515-11057-0027 THERE WAS SILENCE 
lbi-4515-11057-0028 THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE LIKED NICE LOT DIFFERENT SEE MY POSITION 
lbi-4515-11057-0029 RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME 
lbi-4515-11057-0030 JUST NOW HE NEEDED A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT 
lbi-4515-11057-0031 YOU DON'T NOTICE ANY FALLING OFF IN ONE QUICK RECENTLY 
lbi-4515-11057-0032 DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY 
lbi-4515-11057-0033 SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WENT THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE 
lbi-4515-11057-0034 HISTORIAN THAT ELS PIPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION 
lbi-4515-11057-0035 AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER WRIST OR RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER 
lbi-4515-11057-0036 I SUPPOSE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION 
lbi-4515-11057-0037 JOHN LOOKED AT ME WITH AN IRONICAL SMILE HE PLEADED 
lbi-4515-11057-0038 I COULDN'T GO ABOUT DECLARING THAT I WAS HOT OR CAN IN ANY EVENT I MUST BE CONTENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE ME ACCORDING TO THE DISPOSITION AND JUDGMENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE A FRIGHTFUL WHAT CAN I DO 
lbi-4515-11057-0039 THE CASE IS TOO DELICATE WIFE A FAMILIAR VOICE 
lbi-4515-11057-0040 WELL I'LL GET BACK TO MY SCRIBBLING 
lbi-4515-11057-0041 I CAN JUST TO HELP A WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPERFLUOUS MOVEMENT 
lbi-4515-11057-0042 YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY 
lbi-4515-11057-0043 MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE ERROR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S COUNTENANCE 
lbi-4515-11057-0044 SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THE SUMMONS OF THE PAINTING WITH WHICH SHE APPROACHED WAS HOT COALS BY THE ANXIOUS THOUGHTS OF HER HEART 
lbi-4515-11057-0045 HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY 
lbi-4515-11057-0046 HE GAVE HER SUCH DETAILS AS HE HAD OBTAINED THEM ADDED 
lbi-4515-11057-0047 THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPANIONS FALLEN IN THE BATTLE 
lbi-4515-11057-0048 I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LUCKY FELLOW MARION WHAT 
lbi-4515-11057-0049 YOU ARE BETTER FITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY JASPER 
lbi-4515-11057-0050 MORE OF A BRICK BUILDING 
lbi-4515-11057-0051 YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DIDN'T 
lbi-4515-11057-0052 I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFFAIRS HE WENT ON PRESENTLY 
lbi-4515-11057-0053 YES 
lbi-4515-11057-0054 WILL YOU MARRY ME AND LET US TAKE A CHANCE 
lbi-4515-11057-0055 YOU FEEL YOURSELF INDISPENSABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT 
lbi-4515-11057-0056 I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER 
lbi-4515-11057-0057 SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY 
lbi-4515-11057-0058 JULIA I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLOCKED 
lbi-4515-11057-0059 ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU 
lbi-4515-11057-0060 WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MOWBRAY 
lbi-4515-11057-0061 AND IF HE OBSTINATELY REFUSES WHAT THEN WAS HIS BEFORE HIM 
lbi-4515-11057-0062 SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED 
lbi-4515-11057-0063 AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS A VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU ARE MY WIFE 
lbi-4515-11057-0064 IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARION AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO 
lbi-4515-11057-0065 EXCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER WAS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT 
lbi-4515-11057-0066 DO YOU THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE 
lbi-4515-11057-0067 THAT IS JUST WHAT HER DISORDERED HIS IMPOSSIBLE MAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH 
lbi-4515-11057-0068 I COULDN'T TRUST MYSELF 
lbi-4515-11057-0069 BUT SHALL WE FIGHT THEM WILLINGLY 
lbi-4515-11057-0070 PUT UP YOUR UMBRELLA MARION 
lbi-4515-11057-0071 WHAT DO I CARE FOR RECOVERING SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASSIONATE SADNESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU 
lbi-4515-11057-0072 EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK SEEMS INTENDED TO DISHEARTEN ME 
lbi-4515-11057-0073 WHY NEED YOU CONCEAL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH 
lbi-4515-11057-0074 IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DISTRUST YOURSELF 
lbi-4515-11057-0075 WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MARION 
lbi-4515-11057-0076 HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH A CITY AS THIS 
lbi-4515-11057-0077 I DO WISH IT 
lbi-4515-11057-0078 HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT ON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED 
lbi-4515-11057-0079 THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING TO HER PARENTS 
lbi-4515-11057-0080 YOU ARE SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAT I DID CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME 
lbi-4515-11057-0081 IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY FATHER 
lbi-4515-11057-0082 GOOD GOLD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARION I CAN'T STAND IT 
lbi-4515-11057-0083 I WILL BE FAITHFUL TO YOU 
lbi-4515-11057-0084 HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARY TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A CORK TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM 
lbi-4515-11057-0085 MAVICK TOO FOR HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUND OF SOBBING 
lbi-4515-11057-0086 WHAT CAN THEY BE MORE SELFISHNESS 
lbi-4515-11057-0087 BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS 
lbi-4515-11057-0088 YOU DON'T LOVE ME JESSICA AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING 
lbi-4515-11057-0089 HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US OR TO FIGHT 
lbi-4515-11057-0090 IS IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY 
lbi-4515-11057-0091 BUT IF YOU HAD SAID HE LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER 
lbi-4515-11057-0092 IF I BELIEVED ANYTHING I BELIEVED THAT I DID LOVE YOU 
lbi-4515-11057-0093 WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW 
lbi-4515-11057-0094 REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DISREGARDED PRICELESS LOVE SUCH AS YOURS TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PROUD POSITION AMONG FOOLS AND KNAVES INDEED THAT'S WHAT IT'S COME TO ME 
lbi-4515-11057-0095 SOON ENOUGH SHE WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED WHAT PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT 
lbi-4515-11057-0096 WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH 
lbi-4515-11057-0097 IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN A GENTLEWOMAN AND FULL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH 
lbi-4515-11057-0098 MARION WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET HER ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT MEETING DURING THAT TIME 
lbi-4515-11057-0099 THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH 
lbi-4515-11057-0100 THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO WRIGGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST 
lbi-4515-11057-0101 JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY 
lbi-4515-11057-0102 ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM THIS 
lbi-4515-11057-0103 GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARION YOUR COB WORK 
lbi-4515-11057-0104 I MUST AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE 
lbi-4515-11057-0105 GOOD BYE SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND 
lbi-4515-11057-0106 I LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THAT MARY HAD LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY 
lbi-4515-11057-0107 JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO HAS SUFFERED A SEVERE HUMILIATION 
lbi-4515-11057-0108 HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNIZED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TIMES OF ASPECT 
lbi-4515-11057-0109 A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM 
lbi-4515-11057-0110 YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED A FINAL ANSWER OF REFUSAL 
lbi-4515-11057-0111 YOU WILL UNDERSTAND I SHOLY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OFF YOU 
lbi-4515-11057-0112 YOU'RE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU 
lbi-4515-11057-0113 SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THEY CAME A REPLY 
lbi-4515-11057-0114 I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF OR BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH 
lbi-116-288048-0000 A NUMBER OF OTHER DAYS WERE OBSERVED BY THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT VARIOUS TIMES AS THE BIRTHDAY OF JESUS THE GOSPEL GIVES NO DATE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNCERTAIN REALLY IGNORANT ABOUT IT 
lbi-116-288048-0001 YET THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY 
lbi-116-288048-0002 WHY THIS DISCREPANCY IN HISTORICAL DOCUMENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INSPIRATION 
lbi-116-288048-0003 AGAIN MATTHEW SAYS THAT TO ESCAPE THE EVIL DESIGNS OF HEROD MARY AND JOSEPH WITH THE INFANT JESUS FLED INTO EGYPT LUKE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT HIS HURRIED FLIGHT NOR OF HARRIET'S INTENTION TO KILL THE INFANT MESSIAH 
lbi-116-288048-0004 WHEN I COME TO MORE IMPORTANT CHAPTERS ABOUT JESUS WE MEET WITH GREATER DIFFICULTIES 
lbi-116-288048-0005 WAS ALWAYS ON A FRIDAY THAT THE CRUCIFIXION HAS COMMEMORATED THE WEEK IN WHICH THE DAY OCCURS VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR 
lbi-116-288048-0006 GOOD FRIDAY FALLS NOT BEFORE THE SPRING EQUINOX BUT SOON AFTER THE SPRING EQUINOX AS THE FULL MOON WAS THUS MAKING A CALCULATION TO DEPEND UPON THE POSITION OF THE SUN AND ZODIAC AND PHASES OF THE MOON 
lbi-116-288048-0007 THE PAGAN AUSTRALIA HAS BECOME A CHRISTIAN EASTER 
lbi-116-288048-0008 BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE OR IN OFFERS OF FOLLY METAPHYSICAL ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS TYPICAL SAYS ONE 
lbi-116-288048-0009 IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MYTHOLOGY AT ALL HE SEEMS TO ARGUE WHY OBJECT TO ADDING TO IT A MISS OF JESUS 
lbi-116-288048-0010 THE IMMEDIATE COMPANIONS OF JESUS APPEARED TO BE A MOTHER AND AS MYTHICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF 
lbi-116-288048-0011 WHO WAS MATTHEW WHO WAS MARKED 
lbi-116-288048-0012 YOU ARE JOHN AFTER JUDAS AND MARY 
lbi-116-288048-0013 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXISTED 
lbi-116-288048-0014 IF PETER EVER WENT TO ROME THE NEW DOCTRINE HOW'S THAT NO HISTORIAN HAS TAKEN NOTE OF HIM 
lbi-116-288048-0015 HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRESENCE OF A MYTH 
lbi-116-288048-0016 IT WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEM 
lbi-116-288048-0017 PETER PAUL JOHN JAMES JUDAS OCCUPY THE STAGE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY 
lbi-116-288048-0018 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN WHY THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JESUS THE AUTHORS AND HISTORIANS OF HIS TIME NOT TAKE NOTICE OF HIM 
lbi-116-288048-0019 THEY HAD BEEN A CONSPIRACY AGAINST HIM 
lbi-116-288048-0020 HOUSES HIS UNANIMOUS SILENCE BE ACCOUNTED FOR 
lbi-116-288048-0021 HOW THEN ARE WE TO DECIDE WHICH OF THE NUMEROUS CANDIDATES FOR DIVINE HONORS SHOULD BE HUMAN OR BOTH 
lbi-116-288048-0022 AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IS ALWAYS MAINTAINED AT A SWORD NOW AND BY HOW FAR HEREAFTER 
lbi-116-288048-0023 YET THE MOST IMPOSSIBLE UTTERANCES ARE PUT INTO HIS MOUTH 
lbi-116-288048-0024 ONLY A MYTHICAL JESUS CAN VIRTUALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERNMENT FAVORS TO QUARTERS YOU HAVE PETITIONS TO PRESS UPON HIS ATTENTION 
lbi-116-288048-0025 MOREOVER IF JESUS COULD KEEP HIS PROMISE THEY WOULD BE TODAY NO MISERY IN THE WORLD NO ORPHANS NO CHILD AS MOTHERS KNOW SHIPWRECKS NO FLOODS NO FAMINE'S NO DISEASE NO CRIPPLED CHILDREN NO INSANITY NO WARS NO CRIME NO WRONG 
lbi-116-288048-0026 HAD THESE PRAYER HAS BEEN ANSWERED 
lbi-116-288048-0027 HOW MANY SELF DELUDED PROPHECIES EXTRAVAGANT CLAIMS ARE PRODUCED 
lbi-116-288048-0028 AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT CAUSED BY SUCH IMPOSSIBLE PROMISES 
lbi-116-288048-0029 THE SANDWICH OF PREACHERS OF THE DAY YOU HE PARRIED HIS AUNTS WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROMISE WAS RETAKEN WITH THE PROVISION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT FOR OUR GOOD 
lbi-116-288048-0030 BUT HE SAID IF YE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU 
lbi-116-288048-0031 DID HE NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID 
lbi-116-288048-0032 SELF EFFORT AND PRAYER IS A REMEDY AGAINST IGNORANCE SLAVERY POVERTY AND MORAL DEGRADATION 
lbi-1255-138279-0000 IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SORRA MAY COME TO THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT CAUSING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INCONGRUITY WHEN WITH IMPRESSIBLE PUSSONS LOVE BECOMES CENSUS JUSTNESS HOPE SINKS TO MISGIVING UNFAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EXERCISE OF MEMORY DOES NOT STUFF FEELINGS OF REGRET AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMBITION TO BE PASSED BY AND ANTICIPATION DOES NOT PROMPT TO ENTERPRISE 
lbi-1255-138279-0001 STILL TO A CLOSE OBSERVER THEY ARE JUST AS PERCEPTIBLE THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE MEDIA OF MANIFESTATION ARE LESS TRITE AND FAMILIAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONES AS THE BURSTING OF THE BUDS OR THE FALL OF THE LEAF 
lbi-1255-138279-0002 IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARKER THAN THE SKY IT WAS THE WILL AND IF ANYTHING COULD BE GLOOMIER THAN THE WOOL IT WAS THE RIVER BENEATH 
lbi-1255-138279-0003 AN INDESCRIBABLE SUCCESSION OF DULL BLOWS PERPLEXING IN THE REGULARITY SENT THE SOUND WITH DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE FLUFFY ATMOSPHERE 
lbi-1255-138279-0004 NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVED BY THE BRINK OF THE RIVER 
lbi-1255-138279-0005 THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS POSITIVELY DISCOVERABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN 
lbi-1255-138279-0006 THE SHAPE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EXERTION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INCHES DEEP 
lbi-1255-138279-0007 AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKEN ALOUD ONE 
lbi-1255-138279-0008 TWO THREE 
lbi-1255-138279-0009 FULL FIVE 
lbi-1255-138279-0010 BETWEEN EACH UTTERANCE THE LITTLE SHAPE ADVANCED ABOUT HALF A DOZEN YARDS 
lbi-1255-138279-0011 HERE THE SPOT STOPPED AND DWINDLED SMALLER 
lbi-1255-138279-0012 THEN A MORSEL OF SNOW FLEW ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIFTH WHEN DEAD 
lbi-1255-138279-0013 THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SMOOTH SALT WHICH RACES MIDDLIN DECIDES WITH THE SAME GLIDING PRECISION ANY IRREGULARITIES OF SPEED BEING IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED A SMALL WHIRLPOOL 
lbi-1255-138279-0014 THEY NEVER STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER 
lbi-1255-138279-0015 THEN A NOISE WAS HEARD APPARENTLY PRODUCED BY THE OPENING OF THE WINDOW 
lbi-1255-138279-0016 SAID THE BLOOD SPOT ON THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY 
lbi-1255-138279-0017 I ASKED WHAT WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME 
lbi-1255-138279-0018 WHEN I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT 
lbi-1255-138279-0019 OH MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK 
lbi-1255-138279-0020 I HAVE MONEY 
lbi-1255-138279-0021 I BELIEVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WHAT THEN 
lbi-1255-138279-0022 IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL 
lbi-1255-138279-0023 THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK 
lbi-1255-138279-0024 GOOD NIGHT FRANK GOOD NIGHT 
lbi-1255-74899-0000 THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES 
lbi-1255-74899-0001 BUT THE COUNTESS NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH 
lbi-1255-74899-0002 THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO BY AUNT JUDY 
lbi-1255-74899-0003 I SHOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH HIM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WILL MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST 
lbi-1255-74899-0004 BUT THE GIRL BEGGED FOR SOME TO DAY 
lbi-1255-74899-0005 IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRES TO BE CONSIDERED 
lbi-1255-74899-0006 PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM 
lbi-1255-74899-0007 HE WILL PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN 
lbi-1255-74899-0008 OUGHT I TO RECEIVE TWO CUSTIS LEE HAD LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTAND THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTED HIM AS ONE OF THE WORK AS A DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LITTLE FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY 
lbi-1255-74899-0009 THE POLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID 
lbi-1255-74899-0010 BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE TO MARRY IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY YOU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE PAUL VERY FAR TOWARDS THE ALLA 
lbi-1255-74899-0011 AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH 
lbi-1255-74899-0012 WHEN YOU ARE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THE LAST TO 
lbi-1255-74899-0013 IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND 
lbi-1255-74899-0014 WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MYSTIFIED SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BE NEITHER 
lbi-1255-74899-0015 I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWN SHE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED 
lbi-1255-74899-0016 WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND 
lbi-1255-74899-0017 IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID 
lbi-1255-74899-0018 AND A BLUE ONE TO BE BURIED AND HAS ASKED ME 
lbi-1255-74899-0019 MUST HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT AND OUT IN THE MORNING 
lbi-1255-74899-0020 I SOON RECEIVED DONNED MY WORSTED STOCKING SWEETHEART 
lbi-1255-74899-0021 I CAN DO THAT TOO 
lbi-1255-74899-0022 NOW SIT DOWN TO WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD 
lbi-4570-102353-0000 WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR THE TERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM 
lbi-4570-102353-0001 SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES ARE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WAVED IN A NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES 
lbi-4570-102353-0002 THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN A MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS 
lbi-4570-102353-0003 INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY 
lbi-4570-102353-0004 THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LAW 
lbi-4570-102353-0005 UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LISTERS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION 
lbi-4570-102353-0006 AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW 
lbi-4570-102353-0007 THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE AND THE APPOINTMENT TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT 
lbi-4570-102353-0008 I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT ARVID HORN ANY INFERIOR ISSUE 
lbi-4570-14911-0000 NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOX HOUND ARE MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIEYES 
lbi-4570-14911-0001 IF YOU WANT TO HUNT OR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE WRITING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES AS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES 
lbi-4570-14911-0002 IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOR IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE 
lbi-4570-14911-0003 BUT COPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH TO BE INURED TO THEIR WORK 
lbi-4570-14911-0004 HE HAS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT AND THE BIGGER ROUND LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND CLAUSE 
lbi-4570-14911-0005 AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE 
lbi-4570-14911-0006 IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH A WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTER HOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BELOW A GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BUGLE 
lbi-4570-14911-0007 THEN A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE OR WERE BREAD BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HARRIER INVEIGLE ASSOCIATIONS WARM AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBOROUGH HOUND SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM 
lbi-4570-14911-0008 THEN THEY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY 
lbi-4570-14911-0009 ONE HEARS NOW OF THE CHARLESTON THE HOUSE TOOK PLACE VERY NOTED INDEED THE WHOLE SCENE THE LEAFY PARK THIS TOOK PLACE THE OTHER BIRD THE OFFICER PUTTING THE TRINITY FOOT THE WOODY DALE MISSUS DURBY HILLIARD'S NISIDA'S PRICES AND MISSUS TURNER SAYS

lbi-5849-50962-0006 OH I SEE SAID BERT THE LINE WILL STRETCH THEN AND THE BREECHES BUOY OR GO ON A PULLEY 
lbi-5849-50962-0007 IT WAS CLEAR DAY NOW AND MUCH OF THE WICKED STORM HAD PASSED 
lbi-5849-50962-0008 WITH THE DAYLIGHT CAME GIRLS AND WOMEN TO THE BEACH 
lbi-5849-50962-0009 MISSUS BOBBSEY MISSUS MINTURN NELLIE AND HER MOTHER BESIDES DOROTHY AND NAN WERE ALL THERE FLOSSIE AND FREDDIE BEING OBLIGED TO STAY HOME WITH DINERS SUSAN 
lbi-5849-50962-0010 OF COURSE THE GIRLS ASKED ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS AND BURTON HOW TRIED TO ANSWER THEM AS BEST THEY COULD 
lbi-5849-50962-0011 IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BOY WAS RETURNING 
lbi-5849-50962-0012 NEARER AND NEARER IT CAME UNTIL NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN 
lbi-5849-50962-0013 THE GIRLS AND WOMEN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER 
lbi-5849-50962-0014 A BIG ROLLER DASHING AND FINISH THE WORK FOR THE LACE CURTAINS AND A MAN IN THE COURT POPE BOUNDED UP ON SHORE 
lbi-5849-50962-0015 EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND NELLY WITH THE STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MEN 
lbi-5849-50962-0016 OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FALLING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN 
lbi-5849-50962-0017 BUT THE HALF DROWNED MAN RUBBED HIS EYES AS IF HE HAD NOT BELIEVED THEM THEN THE NEXT MINUTE HE PRESSED HIS LITTLE DAUGHTER WAS HURT UNABLE TO SPEAK A WORD 
lbi-5849-50962-0018 AND AS GEORGE BRINGING OUT THEIR ANXIOUSLY ASKED THE BROTHER

lbi-5849-50963-0000 A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THE DREADFUL STORM 
lbi-5849-50963-0001 AND EVERYBODY WAS SO HAPPY 
lbi-5849-50963-0002 THE NEPTUNE THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON A SAND BAR BUT NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT AND ROW BOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED 
lbi-5849-50963-0003 THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A FEVER

lbi-5849-50963-0006 WE COUNTED ON GETTING HOME LAST WEEK WHEN THIS LAST STORM STRUCK US AND DROVE US OUT OF OUR COURSE 
lbi-5849-50963-0007 ABOUT THE VALUE AS MISTER BOBBSEY WHO WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY 
lbi-5849-50963-0008 THE VALUE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR

lbi-5849-50963-0010 YES INDEED IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN US A LIFE TIME TO ACCUMULATE AS MUCH MONEY AS WE HAVE EARNED IN A CHEER 
lbi-5849-50963-0011 NEITHER AUNT EMILY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHOPPING TOUR SUGGESTED NAN 
lbi-5849-50963-0012 HE NEEDS A CLERK TERM OF ALL THE TRUCK FROM THE ISLAND I GUESS EVERYBODY WAS GLAD THE ARMY FELL DOWN 
lbi-5849-50963-0013 THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST TASTE AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM ITS PERFECT EXERCISE 
lbi-5849-50964-0000 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOODBYE TO YOU NELLY TOLD DOROTHY AGAIN NEXT MORNING 
lbi-5849-50964-0001 OH THAT WILL BE SPLENDID DECLARED NAN

lbi-5849-50964-0003 AND DOROTHY WENT UP AND DOWN THE ROOM LIKE THE PICTURES OF CINDERELLA'S PROUD SISTERS 
lbi-5849-50964-0004 AND WE'LL BE ON HAND THANK YOU REPLIED THE JOKING DOROTHY 
lbi-5849-50964-0005 COME NELLY CALLED MISSUS MACLAUGHLIN I'M READY WHERE'S YOUR HAT

lbi-5849-50964-0007 MY UNCLE'S A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE US THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE 
lbi-5849-50964-0008 MOST OF THEM I GUESS ANSWERED BERT 
lbi-5849-50964-0009 WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD EDUCATION AND I'M WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN 
lbi-5849-50964-0010 SO AM I DECLARED NAN VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK 
lbi-5849-50964-0011 MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FREDDIE AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP 
lbi-5849-50964-0012 THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT 
lbi-5849-50964-0013 AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION 
lbi-6123-59150-0000 HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK WILL GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY AND EPILEPTIC FITS ARE A HYSTERICALLY 
lbi-6123-59150-0001 IF DOSTOIEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRONGER 
lbi-6123-59150-0002 LIKE HIM HE IS A NOVELIST OF TORTURE 
lbi-6123-59150-0003 SAID HENRIK A LUST OF CRUELTY LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS INDUSTRIOUS MEN AND WOMEN 
lbi-6123-59150-0004 HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL ALSO 
lbi-6123-59150-0005 BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT 
lbi-6123-59150-0006 EVEN AT LAST IS NEVER SO ODDLY INTO THE LAST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MEN 
lbi-6123-59150-0007 THE STAIRCASE COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SOONER NARRATIVES IN RESURRECTION 
lbi-6123-59150-0008 THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRY SUMMONING DEITIES 
lbi-6123-59150-0009 ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION 
lbi-6123-59150-0010 EVEN THE TALK IS OF ACTIONS MOULDER NOBODIES 
lbi-6123-59150-0011 HE SAW HIS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND THAT WITH THE SACK 
lbi-6123-59150-0012 BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH AND A YELLOW DAISY CHAIN WHICH SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE 
lbi-6123-59150-0013 HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND A TENDER WAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AGAIN TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE 
lbi-6123-59150-0014 HE NEVER PAINTS EVERY MAN HEARS PROJECTS D'ESTAIRE SKI OR A NIGHTMARE DOSTOIEVSKY 
lbi-6123-59150-0015 THAT IS A CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ANY CORRECTION OR OF FATHERS AND SONS 
lbi-6123-59150-0016 WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEEDED THE CRIME 
lbi-6123-59150-0017 HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION 
lbi-6123-59150-0018 ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE NOT AS AN ABNORMAL ACTIVITY 
lbi-6123-59150-0019 HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUE AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUENESS 
lbi-6123-59150-0020 WAS VERY FOND OF HUNTING CATS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY 
lbi-6123-59150-0021 AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE BETRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS 
lbi-6123-59150-0022 SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY 
lbi-6123-59150-0023 IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM OH COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM 
lbi-6123-59150-0024 IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOIEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR 
lbi-6123-59150-0025 NO MILLER DRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENTS UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY 
lbi-6123-59150-0026 THE TASK WAS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE 
lbi-6123-59150-0027 ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS FOURTEEN BY NAME GENERAL EPANCHIN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZABETHA PROKOFIEVNA YEVGENY PETROVITCH RUDINSKY PRINCESS GOOD KRENSKI AGLAE A PRINCE MUISHKIN COLIA IVOLGIN EQUALLY LOYAL FETISH ANCHOR NASTASIA PHILIPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GUNYAH TO SIN AND GENERAL IVOLGIN 
lbi-6123-59150-0028 BUT THE SACRED DUST EXCUSE APPEAL TO SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MOST ACUTE THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS 
lbi-6123-59150-0029 MISTER MURRAY BOLDLY FACES A DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS AT DEFINITION 
lbi-6123-59150-0030 DO HIM JUSTICE HIS WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF A STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF 
lbi-6123-59150-0031 AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE INCESSANT UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVING SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN CERTAIN SURROUNDING DARKNESS 
lbi-6123-59150-0032 ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATION OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOONER 
lbi-6123-59150-0033 BECAUSE THEY POSSESS THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN 
lbi-6123-59150-0034 THIS IS OWING IN A MEASURE TRUE 
lbi-6123-59150-0035 TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF JUSTICE HIS WORK ENGLISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL IS AT BOTTOM A DOUBT AND IN DESPAIR 
lbi-6123-59150-0036 THERE IS IN DUSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD AND SERVE TABLES 
lbi-6123-59150-0037 THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE A DUSKY IS AS CHRISTIANS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF 
lbi-6123-59150-0038 AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE KNIGHT GUSTAVUS HE STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION 
lbi-6123-59150-0039 ARRIVING BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS BUT PRINCE MUISHKIN IN THE IDIOT 
lbi-6123-59150-0040 HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT 
lbi-6123-59150-0041 THE NOBLES OF THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN 
lbi-6123-59150-0042 AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF IN A CONFIDENTIAL WAY DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE 
lbi-6123-59150-0043 WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT WHEN I COULD HAVE SWORN THAT WHEN ITS MEANING BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS HE PASSED THE TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS 
lbi-6123-59150-0044 AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SCENE ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SINKS 
lbi-6123-59150-0045 THUS SUPPORTED THE MEN ONE SEES BEHIND US KNOWS THE PORTRAIT WHEN MY OWNERS HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOBLES 
lbi-6123-59150-0046 IT IS A FIGURE AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS 
lbi-6123-59186-0000 HE HAS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT TO SIENA 
lbi-6123-59186-0001 HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STILL 
lbi-6123-59186-0002 TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARDY'S NEITHER SUFFICIENTLY ARTICULATE NO SUFFICIENTLY FACILITIES TO BE A GREAT POET 
lbi-6123-59186-0003 HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EASY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS AND IMAGES 
lbi-6123-59186-0004 THUS HE WRITES WHEN I FOUND HER AT A RUN 
lbi-6123-59186-0005 THEY COULD NOT BE AN UGLY AND MORE PROSAIC EXAGGERATION DAYS CONTAINED IN THE ETERNAL ARSLAN 
lbi-6123-59186-0006 IN PROSE INTRUDES AND CHOICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAGES 
lbi-6123-59186-0007 TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE USE OF THE WORD DOMICILED IN THE PASSAGE IN THE SAME POEM THE 
lbi-6123-59186-0008 BUT REALLY THE STRANGEST SORT OF CATERING CARE VEILED SMILES BESPEAK THE THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE 
lbi-6123-59186-0009 CATERING CARRIES AN APPALLING PHRASE 
lbi-6123-59186-0010 IS A LINE OF GREEK POETRY 
lbi-6123-59186-0011 YOU DID NOT COME AND MARCHING TIME GIRONDIN WARMLY NUMB YET LOST PHILOSOPHY TO DAY PRESENTS THE VENDETTA THUS FOUND LACKING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMPASSION WHICH CAN OVERBEAR RELUCTANCE THE PURE LOVING KINDNESS SAKE GRIEVED I WENT AS A HOBO STROKED ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME 
lbi-6123-59186-0012 THERE ARE HINTS OF THE GRAND STYLE OF LYRIC POETRY IN THESE LINES BUT PHRASES LUCK IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STROKED ITS SUM A DISCOURSE THAT IT CAN BRING TO THE LIBERALS OF BICKERING AND COMMONPLACE 
lbi-6123-59186-0013 HE HAS A TEMPERAMENT SENSITIVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW RECENT WRITERS TO THE PAIN AND PASSION OF HUMAN BEINGS 
lbi-6123-59186-0014 ONE CAN REMEMBER PAUL OFF TO PAUL OF HIS WITH A THEME THAT MIGHT EASILY HAVE SAID FROM MISTER HEARTY TO MAKE CHRISTINA THE LOST MISTRESS THE LAST RIDE TOGETHER THE STATUE AND THE BUST TO NAME A FEW 
lbi-6123-59186-0015 BUT WHAT A SENSE OF CHILD MARRIAGE AND GRANNY'S TRAGEDIES 
lbi-6123-59186-0016 HIS ROAD AS A PLACE OF OPULENCE NOTE OF PITY 
lbi-6123-59186-0017 TO HAVE LOVED HIM FOR ANALOGIES WITH BROWNING TO LIVE FOREVER AFTER IN THE INHERITANCE OF A MIGHTY ACHIEVEMENT 
lbi-6123-59186-0018 TO HAVE LIVED FOR AN ALLY IN MISTER HARDY'S IMAGINATION TO DEEPEN THE SADNESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE'S MEMORIES 
lbi-6123-59186-0019 FOR THEN I AM DISTRESSED BUT HAS GROWN COLD TO ME COULD ANY RATES MY ENDLESS REST WITH EQUANIMITY 
lbi-6123-59186-0020 BUT TIME TO MAKE ME GRIEVE PUSTULES LET'S PART ABIDE AND SHAKES THIS FRAGILE FRAME AN AGE WITH THROBBINGS OF NOONTIDE 
lbi-6123-59186-0021 AND DESPAIR IS BY NO MEANS TRIUMPHANT IN WHAT IS PERHAPS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE BUT ONLY THE HONEYCOMBS THE OXEN 
lbi-6123-59186-0022 YOU PITCH INTO MEEK MILD CHRISTIANS WHERE THEY DWELT IN THIS DURING TEN NOR DID IT OCCUR TO ONE OF US THE TWO GOT AWAY KNEELING THEN 
lbi-6123-59186-0023 THE MAN OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT AND A MEMORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HODDER'S PREVAILING MOOD 
lbi-6123-59186-0024 HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITH THE IRONICAL DUCKS THEY WERE SOON SO MANY MUCH AWAY 
lbi-6123-59186-0025 HOW LONG HE CRIES IN A POEM WRITTEN SOME YEARS AGO 
lbi-6123-59186-0026 WHEN SHALL THE SANTA SOPHIA POLITIES WHERE WE AGAIN HAVE SWAY AND EACH PROUD LAND AND PATRIOTISM GROWING GARLIC SCORN DISDAIN BEEN SLAVE TO REALMS BUT SEVERAL ESTANCIAS 
lbi-6123-59186-0027 BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINES LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT MELANCHOLY POEM THE SOULS OF THE SLAIN IN WHICH THE SOULS OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS RETURN TO THE COUNTRY IN QUESTION A SENIOR SO LAME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES HAVE KEPT THE DOUGHTY DEEDS IN REMEMBRANCE 
lbi-6123-59186-0028 AND GENERAL HOWARD AT HER SWEETHEART'S SWOLLEN LOYAL AS DOVES 
lbi-6123-59186-0029 SOME PHYSICAL INFLATE HUTS AND FOUND THE NEW CLOTHES 
lbi-6123-59186-0030 AND OUR WIVES QUOTH ANOTHER REASONABLY DOUBT DIANA DEEDS 
lbi-6123-59186-0031 MISTER HARDY HAS TO BITTEREST SENSE OF REALITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GLORY OF WAR 
lbi-6123-59186-0032 THE FAREWELL TO MISTER HUDDY IS THE ROAD OF ANCIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE HIDEOUS IRRELEVANCE 
lbi-6123-59186-0033 IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HUDDY'S PONES BOUTWELL AN EMERALD EXPRESSING THE TRAJECTORY CHARITY THAN HIS POEMS ABOUT LOVE 
lbi-6123-59186-0034 HE TOOK IT AND FRUSTRATION THE EVER RECURRING THEMES IN BOTH 
lbi-6123-59186-0035 HIS LOVE IS LIKE A SOLDIER'S ROTTENNESS DEFEATED THE GLORY 
lbi-6123-59186-0036 LEVASSEUR OR A SERVANT BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH 
lbi-6123-59186-0037 IN BEYOND THE LAST THAT WE HAD THE SAME MOURNFUL CRY OF A SEVERANCE 
lbi-6123-59186-0038 NO SHADE OF PINNEY COOL A TRAIL TOWN WELL ETHEN JOE'S WHEREFORE IN MY MOUNT AND WITHIN THE PALACE STILL UNTO YOURS WHEN ROBIN NEVER HAUNT A CHEAP GREEN COVETOUSNESS 
lbi-6123-59186-0039 THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPERIENCE INTENSER THAN ELLEN 
lbi-6123-59186-0040 NOTHING OF TINIEST BIRTH HAVE I WROUGHT PENDANT PLANNED NO RUM THING ASKING BLAME OR PRAISE SINCE THE PALE CORPSE THE BIRTH OF THIS DIANA UNITS BEARING BLANKS IN ALL ITS RAYS DULLEST OF THIRTY DAYS 
lbi-6267-53049-0000 IT'S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LACK BRAINS WHEN SHE WANTS TO BE A TEACHER ISN'T IT 
lbi-6267-53049-0001 THEN ADOLPHE HAS THOUGHT SO HARD OR GOING TO AND SHE HASN'T GONE ANYWHERE JUST NOW ALTHOUGH SISTER WISTFULLY 
lbi-6267-53049-0002 DORIES DREAMED OF PRETTY DRESSES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY 
lbi-6267-53049-0003 SO IT MUST BE CONFESSED THE BENEVOLENT THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED IT FOR THE WORLD 
lbi-6267-53049-0004 SHE KNEW THE PENALTY HAD STARTED OUT TO SAY A NEW DRESS 
lbi-6267-53049-0005 DOROTHY'S CONDUCT I BELIEVE IT'S AN AULD GUID 
lbi-6267-53049-0006 THE SUN CANNOT BE MY DEAR DORIS 
lbi-6267-53049-0007 NOT A BANDANNA AND YOURSELF 
lbi-6267-53049-0008 YOUR AFFECTIONATE AND ORDERED A HALT 
lbi-6267-53049-0009 I DON'T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PENELOPE WE AGREE 
lbi-6267-53049-0010 IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS OUR SOCIETY NO 
lbi-6267-53049-0011 DANNY DORY DOESN'T ARGUE A LACK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY ANCESTORS THAT I CAN'T FEEL VERY ENTHUSIASTIC OVER THIS HEIRLOOM ESPECIALLY WHEN GRANDMOTHER HUNGER DIE YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN 
lbi-6267-53049-0012 IT WAS THE KIND OF FOND OF THE KNOT OF SANDY SAID DORIS DUTIFULLY 
lbi-6267-53049-0013 WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRETTIER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED BEN AN O P 
lbi-6267-53049-0014 WHAT LOVELY OLIVES DIOMEDE STUFF AND NOT A BIT SIDE

lbi-6267-53049-0018 IT IS SOMETHING TO ALSO AS AN HEIRLOOM OFTEN ARE 
lbi-6267-53049-0019 THEN IT'LL BE A SURPRISE AS MUCH AS THE THUNDER CEASED UTTERLY HEART COULD WISH THEM WHEN DORIES FLASHED ON HER DOOM FONDLY AND THE EVENING ON THE BAR BETWEEN THE BLACK SKIRT NICELY BRASS AND RE HUNG AND THE READIEST WAY TO IMAGINE A WAY THAT WAS A POSITIVE CREATION OFF THEY TWO ROWS BEST BRING GOOD SOUP WITH A GIRDLE AND KNOTS OF BLACK VELVET 
lbi-6267-53049-0020 SO THAT A NOBBY WENT A BLACK SPAR D AND HER DRESS WAS A MERE NATION OF IVORY OR THAT 
lbi-6267-53049-0021 AND I NOT BEHOLD HER ALTOGETHER CHARMING 
lbi-6267-53049-0022 SHE LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEPPED OUT OF THE FRAME OF SOME LOVELY OLD BEECHER SHE SAID TO HERSELF 
lbi-6267-53049-0023 MY AUNT ADELA GIVE ME GIVE US THE MONTDIDIER SHE STAMMERED 
lbi-6267-53049-0024 I AM NAMED ALSO MISS FAIRWEATHER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT THE LITTLE BABY AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HOW LOFTY OLIVE FACE AGLOW WITH DELIGHT AND TENDERNESS 
lbi-6267-53049-0025 THEN YOU ARE MY GRAND NIECE SHE SAID 
lbi-6267-53049-0026 WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE RELATED TO HER I SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE TURTLES BOB SAWYER IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN TIBET 
lbi-6267-53049-0027 BUT AT OAKBY WAS FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER 
lbi-6267-53049-0028 SO ENOUGH TO PLEASE OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSE WAS CALLED WAS BROKEN UP 
lbi-6267-53049-0029 MY VIEW I AM A VERY LONELY OLD WOMAN WITH NOBODY BELONGING TO ME 
lbi-6267-53049-0030 NOW SHE THOUGHT THE MISSES FIRE WITH THOSE SOFT OLD HAND AFFECTIONATELY 
lbi-6267-53049-0031 NO RECENT BRENNAN OPIE FALLED DOWN LEAVES AND BRANCHES CHANGED IN THE GLEAM OF AN EYE 
lbi-6267-53049-0032 WHEN MISSUS FAIR WEATHER HAD GONE DORIES AND BEEN AN OBI LOOKED AT EACH OTHER 
lbi-6267-65525-0000 AS SHE SLIPPED INTO HER LITTLE BRAIN AFTERNOON DRESS HER AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BELOW 
lbi-6267-65525-0001 AUNT JANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WITH A LAMP IN ONE HAND AND THE YEAR OLD BABY CLANGING THROUGH THE OTHER 
lbi-6267-65525-0002 SHE WAS A BIG SHAPELESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURED FACE CHEERFUL AND WAGNER AS A SUNFLOWER WAS AUNT JANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASIONS 
lbi-6267-65525-0003 I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BIXBY IS THIS EVENING CITY AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BABY TILL I GET BACK 
lbi-6267-65525-0004 SHE SIGHED AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS FOR THE BABY 
lbi-6267-65525-0005 ARE OUR DAYS WERE ALIKE AS FAR AS OUR WORK AND DOUGLAS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPTED THEM CHEERFULLY AND UNCOMPLAININGLY 
lbi-6267-65525-0006 BUT SHE DID NOT RESENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BABY WHEN SHE WANTED TO WRITE A LETTER 
lbi-6267-65525-0007 THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX ABOVE THE KITCHEN REACH SUDDENLY SHARPLY TOWARDS MARK CAUSES 
lbi-6267-65525-0008 HABIT AND THE COT WHERE THE TEETH OF GARTH'S LAP FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AVAILABLE SPACE

lbi-6599-38591-0012 THE GANGES PLEADED THEIR PRIVILEGE OF NOT BEING LIABLE TO BE TAXED WITHOUT THEIR OWN CONSENT 
lbi-6599-38591-0013 ORDERS HAD BEEN SENT EVERYWHERE TO RECEIVE HIM AS KINGS OF FRANCE ARE RECEIVED ON THEIR JOYOUS ASSENT 
lbi-6841-88291-0000 BUT SINCE THERE EXISTS NO RESPONSIBILITY WHICH EACH REPORTED DUTIFULLY AT THE ROLL CALL OF HABIT AND DROP BACK INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH A GRATEFUL SIGH 
lbi-6841-88291-0001 I REMEMBER THE MOON SAILING A GOOD GAIT AMONG APPARENTLY STATIONARY CLOUDS I RECALL THE DEEP BLACK SHADOW LINED WITH FOUR DISTANT SILVERY MOUNTAINS I GLANCED OVER THE STARK MOTIONLESS CANVASES EACH OF WHICH CONCEALED THEM AND THE AIR TREMBLED WITH THE BELLOWING OF CATTLE IN THE CORRALS

lbi-6841-88291-0007 WE PUSHED OPEN THE WHITE GATE AND ENTERED 
lbi-6841-88291-0008 WHENCE DID WAIT AND THEN TO FINISH A SHEAF OF LONG J H STANTON IRONS IN HIS HAND 
lbi-6841-88291-0009 ALL THE REST SQUATTED ON THEIR HEELS ALONG THE FENCE SMOKING CIGARETTES AND CHATTED TOGETHER 
lbi-6841-88291-0010 THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN SLANTED ACROSS IN ONE GREAT SWEEP FROM THE REMOTE MOUNTAINS 
lbi-6841-88291-0011 HOMER WOODEN IN OLD CALIFORNIA JOHN RODE IN AMONG THE CATTLE 
lbi-6841-88291-0012 AS THE LOOP SETTLED HE JERKED SHARPLY UPWARD EXACTLY AS ONE WOULD STRIKE TO HOOK A BIG FISH 
lbi-6841-88291-0013 HOMER AT THE ROPE TWICE OR THRICE ABOUT THE HORN AND SAID OVER AND ONCE STRIPPED OF ALL THE TIGHT LINE AND TO PRESERVE THE BALANCE 
lbi-6841-88291-0014 NOBODY PAID ANY ATTENTION TO THE CALF 
lbi-6841-88291-0015 BEHIND HIM FOLLOWED HIS ANXIOUS MOTHER HER HEAD SWINGING FROM SIDE TO SIDE NEAR THE FIRE THE HORSE STOPPED 
lbi-6841-88291-0016 THE TWO BULL DOGS IMMEDIATELY POUNCED UPON THE VICTIM 
lbi-6841-88291-0017 IT WAS PROMPTLY FLOPPED OVER ON ITS RIGHT SIDE 
lbi-6841-88291-0018 THUS THE CALF WAS UNABLE TO STRUGGLE 
lbi-6841-88291-0019 WHEN ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE WIND KNOCKED OUT OF YOU OR A RIB OR TWO BROKEN YOU CEASE TO THINK THUS UNNECESSARILY ROUGH 
lbi-6841-88291-0020 HOT IRON YELLED ONE OF THE BULL DOGS 
lbi-6841-88291-0021 MOCKER YELLED THE OTHER 
lbi-6841-88291-0022 THE BRAIN DEPRESSED THEY IRONED SMOOTHLY AGAINST THE FLANK 
lbi-6841-88291-0023 PERHAPS A CALF BLEATED A LITTLE LEST THE HEAT SCORCHED 
lbi-6841-88291-0024 THE RANCHO CHERRY WHICH IS THE PROPER COLOR TO INDICATE DUPE GREENLAND AND A SUCCESSFUL MARK 
lbi-6841-88291-0025 THEN HE KNEW THAT A SWALLOW TAIL ON THE OTHER 
lbi-6841-88291-0026 IT SEEMS TO ME A GREAT DEAL OF UNNECESSARY TWADDLE IS ABROAD AS TO THE EXTREME CRUELTY OF BRANDON

lbi-6841-88291-0033 MISTER FOSSET BULL CALF ALONE PICTORIAL HISTORY SHOWS THE ATTITUDES 
lbi-6841-88291-0034 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS A GORGEOUS CONTRAST BETWEEN ALL THIS FRANTIC AND UNCOMPREHENDING EXCITEMENT AND THE ABSOLUTE MATTER OF FACT IMPERTURBABILITY OF HORSE AND RIDER 
lbi-6841-88291-0035 AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CALF WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BEAST WENT OVER PROMPTLY BIT THE GROUND THE WICK AND WAS POUNCED UPON AND KILLED 
lbi-6841-88291-0036 HE WOULD KILL HIMSELF ON ONE FOOT SCRAMBLED VIGOROUSLY AN INVESTOR GOING BACK TO THE ABRUPT

lbi-6841-88294-0000 AT THIS MOMENT THE HEAVY BEAT OF STORM ON THE ROOF CEASED WITH MIRACULOUS SUDDENNESS LEAVING THE OUTSIDE WORLD EMPTY OF SOUND SAVE FOR THE DRIP DRIP DRIP OF EASE 
lbi-6841-88294-0001 WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFTEN AND AS I WAS LOOKING OUT AT A POPULAR GAME I SAW THEM ALL 
lbi-6841-88294-0002 AT THE SAME INSTANT HEARD THE RIPPLE STILL THROUGH CLOTH AND FELT A SHARP STAB IN THE LEFT LEG 
lbi-6841-88294-0003 THEN A SCATTERED SEA WANTED COMPANY AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND 
lbi-6841-88294-0004 IN PLACE OF IT HE WORE A SHARP STEEL HOOK 
lbi-6841-88294-0005 THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING ALIVE FOR HE WAS BREATHING HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GETS HIT OVER THE HEAD IT DIDN'T SOUND GOOD 
lbi-6841-88294-0006 WHEN A MAN BRINGS AWAY HE'S MOSTLY ALL GONE 
lbi-6841-88294-0007 MEIN GOTT BEDDED OVERHEAD OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS 
lbi-6841-88294-0008 SO ONE FINE DAY COULD WOUND AND SHAPED THE HEEL BUT AS NO SOOTHING SYRUP 
lbi-6841-88294-0009 THEIR COFFIN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRAVE IT WAS THE SEA BLOW HIGH BLOW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUARTER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO SINK THEM IN THE SEA THAN ON THE COAST OF THE HIGH BARBARY 
lbi-6841-88294-0010 IF FEAR MADE MY HAIR RISE TO HEAR HIM WITH A BIG STILL SOLEMN DESERT OUTSIDE IN THE QUIET MOONLIGHT AND SHADOWS AND HIM SITTIN UP STRAIGHT AND GAUNT HIS EYES BLAZED ON EACH SIDE AS BIG EAGLE NOSE AND A SNAKY HAIR HANGING OVER THE ROCK CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD 
lbi-6841-88294-0011 HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO GET HIM BANDAGED UP AND UNSHAPELY AND PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP 
lbi-6841-88294-0012 THEN AGAIN ADDRESSING THE BARBARY SONG TO GO AND LOOK AT THE LITTLE COLORADO FLOWN BY JUST TO BE SURE I HADN'T DONE GONE BELOW WHERE ELSIE JUST TALK 
lbi-6841-88294-0013 HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A KID AND IT GAVE A SORT OF CONVERSATIONS POSIN FOR APPLAUSE 
lbi-6841-88294-0014 I USED TO LISTEN BY THE HOUR BUT NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS WHERE HE CAME FROM OR WHAT HE'D DONE 
lbi-6841-88294-0015 I DIDN'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HIS QUIET 
lbi-6841-88294-0016 EUGENIA DIDN'T BOTHER WITH HIS TALK FOR I DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING BUT SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN 
lbi-6841-88294-0017 HE WAS LYING ON A SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLASE ENEMY BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE 
lbi-6841-88294-0018 WHERE ARE MY CLOTHES HE ASKED VERY INTENSE 
lbi-6841-88294-0019 WHEN LITTLE SQUEEZE TO CATCH DEADLY WEAPONS 
lbi-6841-88294-0020 BUT HE'D BEEN TOO SICK TO LONG ABED 
lbi-6841-88294-0021 IN A MINUTE OR SO HE CAME TO 
lbi-6841-88294-0022 NOW YOU'RE A NICE SWEET PROPOSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME

lbi-6841-88294-0030 HE LOOKED MIGHTY SUSPICIOUS BUT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULDN'T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM 
lbi-6841-88294-0031 AFTER HE'D EATEN A FAIR MEAL HE FELL ASLEEP 
lbi-6841-88294-0032 WHEN I CAME BACK THAT EVENING BUNK WAS EMPTY AND HE WAS GONE 
lbi-6841-88294-0033 I DIDN'T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR TWO DAYS 
lbi-6841-88294-0034 THEN ACCOSTED HIM CUTAWAYS ALL 
lbi-6841-88294-0035 GESSI SUSPICIOUS STOLE TO HIS THANKS AND AFTERWARDS I FOUND THAT MY SURMISE HAD BEEN CORRECT 
lbi-6841-88294-0036 HOWEVER HE DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THAT FRAME OF MIND 
lbi-6841-88294-0037 I RAN A COMB A GUN

lbi-6841-88294-0060 THE DEVIL'S A PREACHER IN THE LAST PIN FEATHER SAID HE 
lbi-6841-88294-0061 WELL THIS THING I'VE GOT TO HAVE BOTH TOGETHER AND SHE MUST BE STOPPED

lbi-6841-88294-0065 WE TALKED THE MATTER OVER AT LENGTH 
lbi-6841-88294-0066 I STOOD FOR A LARGE PARTY 
lbi-6841-88294-0067 HE STRONGLY OPPOSED THIS DEPRECIATING THE SHARES BUT I HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A WILD AND DANGEROUS COUNTRY FINALLY COMPROMISED 
lbi-6841-88294-0068 A THIRD OF THE TREASURE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIVIDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SELECT THE SCHEME DID NOT APPEAL TO HIM 
lbi-700-122866-0000 JUNIOR AVONLEA FOUND IT HARD TO SETTLE DOWN TO A HUMDRUM EXISTENCE AGAIN 
lbi-700-122866-0001 PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I'LL GET USED TO IT BUT I'M AFRAID CONCERTS SPOIL PEOPLE FOR EVERYDAY LIFE 
lbi-700-122866-0002 I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MARILLA DISAPPROVED OF THEM 
lbi-700-122866-0003 I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GROW UP TO BE SENSIBLE YET 
lbi-700-122866-0004 I JUST LAY AWAKE AND IMAGINE THE CONCERT OVER AND OVER AGAIN 
lbi-700-122866-0005 EVENTUALLY HOWEVER AVONLEA SCHOOL SLIPPED BACK INTO ITS OLD GROOVE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTERESTS 
lbi-700-122866-0006 NONE OF US LEARNS TO HAVE ANY DEALINGS WITH THE BELLS BECAUSE THE BELLS HAD DECLARED THAT THE SLOANE HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PROGRAMME AND THE SLOANES HAD RETORTED THAT THE BELLS WERE NOT CAPABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPERLY 
lbi-700-122866-0007 THE WINTER WEEKS SLIPPED BY 
lbi-700-122866-0008 ON ANNE'S BIRTHDAY THEY WERE TRIPPING LIGHTLY DOWN IT KEEPING EYES AND EARS ALERT AMID ALL THE CHATTER FOR MISS DAISY HAD TOLD THEM THAT THEY MUST SOON READ A COMPOSITION ON A WINTER'S WALK IN THE WOODS AND IT BEHOOVED THEM TO BE OBSERVANT 
lbi-700-122866-0009 I CAN SCARCELY REALIZE THAT I'M IN MY TEENS 
lbi-700-122866-0010 IT'S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGHED AT 
lbi-700-122866-0011 RUBY GILLIS THINKS OF NOTHING BUT BOWS SAID AND DISDAINFULLY 
lbi-700-122866-0012 SHE'S ACTUALLY DELIGHTED WHEN ENGLAND WRITES HER NAME UP AND TAKE NOTICE FOR ALL SHE PRETENDS TO BE SO MA'AM 
lbi-700-122866-0013 I'M TRYING TO BE AS MUCH LIKE MISSUS ALLEN AS I POSSIBLY CAN FOR I THINK SHE'S PERFECT

lbi-700-122866-0017 THEY'RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE ASLEEP AND DREAMING PRETTY DREAMS 
lbi-700-122866-0018 I READ IT LAST MONDAY EVENING 
lbi-700-122866-0019 IT'S CALLED THE JEALOUS RIVAL OR IN DEATH NOT DIVIDED 
lbi-700-122866-0020 I READ A SUMMER VILLA AND SHE SAID IT WAS STUFF AND NONSENSE 
lbi-700-122866-0021 IT'S A SAD SWEET STORY 
lbi-700-122866-0022 CRIED DELIA WAS OF REGAL BRUNETTE WITH A CORONET OF MIDNIGHT HAIR AND DEFTLY FLASHING EYES 
lbi-700-122866-0023 HE KNOWS TOO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TWELVE 
lbi-700-122866-0024 THEY GREW IN BEAUTY SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE SIXTEEN 
lbi-700-122866-0025 ASKED RUBY GILLIS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROPOSE BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKELY BE AN AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTERS MARRIED 
lbi-700-122866-0026 BUT SHE PRETENDED TO BE GERALD'S FRIEND THE SAME AS EVER 
lbi-700-122866-0027 LET'S YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CLUB TOLERANT AND WRITE STORIES FOR PRACTICE 
lbi-700-122866-0028 YOU OUGHT TO CULTIVATE YOUR IMAGINATION YOU KNOW MISS DAISY SAYS SO 
lbi-700-122866-0029 ONLY WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT WAY

lbi-700-122866-0031 NO BOYS WERE ALLOWED IN IT OTHER RUBY GILLIS A PINE THAT THEIR ADMISSION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXCITING AND EACH MEMBER HAD TO PRODUCE ONE STORY A WEEK 
lbi-700-122866-0032 EACH GIRL HAS TO READ HER STORY OUT LOUD AND THEN WE'LL TALK IT OVER

lbi-700-122866-0035 THE MORAL IS THE GREAT THING MISTER ALLEN SAYS SO 
lbi-700-122866-0036 I READ ONE OF MY STORIES TO HIM AND MISSUS ALLEN AND THEY BOTH AGREED THAT THE MORAL IS EXCELLENT 
lbi-700-122866-0037 JANE AND RUBY ALMOST ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PATHETIC PARTS 
lbi-700-122866-0038 MISS JOSEPHINE BARRY WROTE BACK THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AMUSING IN HER LIFE 
lbi-700-122866-0039 I'M SURE MISSUS ALLEN WAS NEVER SUCH A SILLY FORGETFUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE 
lbi-700-122866-0040 I FELT SO ENCOURAGED WHEN THEY HEARD THAT 
lbi-700-122866-0041 MISSUS LYNDE SAYS SHE ALWAYS FELT SHOCKED WHEN SHE HEARS OF ANYONE EVER HAVING BEEN NAUGHTY NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE 
lbi-700-122866-0042 NOW I WOULDN'T HAVE FELT THAT WAY 
lbi-700-122867-0000 VANITY AND VEXATION OF SPIRIT 
lbi-700-122867-0001 THE SPRING WAS ABROAD IN THE LAND AMARYLLIS SOBER MIDDLE AGE STEP WAS LIGHTER AND SWIFTER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PRIMAL GLADNESS 
lbi-700-122867-0002 I MUST SAY WITH ALL HER FAULTS I NEVER FOUND HER DISOBEDIENT OR UNTRUSTWORTHY BEFORE AND I'M REAL SORRY TO FIND HER SO NOW 
lbi-700-122867-0003 PERHAPS SHE JUDGED HER TOO HASTILY MARILLA 
lbi-700-122867-0004 OF COURSE I KNEW YOU'D TAKE HER PART MATTIE BUT I'M BRINGING EUROPE NOT YOU 
lbi-700-122867-0005 DEMANDED MARILLA ANXIOUSLY GOING OVER TO THE BED 
lbi-700-122867-0006 AND COWER DEEPER INTO HER PILLOWS AS IF DESIROUS OF HIDING HERSELF FOREVER FROM MORTAL EYES NO

lbi-700-122867-0010 YES IT'S GREEN MOANED ANNE 
lbi-700-122867-0011 I THOUGHT NOTHING CAN BE AS BAD AS RED HAIR 
lbi-700-122867-0012 YOU HAVEN'T GOT INTO ANY SCRAPE FOR OVER TWO MONTHS AND I WAS SURE NEITHER ONE WAS DUE 
lbi-700-122867-0013 NOW THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR 
lbi-700-122867-0014 AND SURELY DIDN'T YOU KNOW IT WAS A WICKED THING TO DO 
lbi-700-122867-0015 YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE WICKED ADMITTED ANNE 
lbi-700-122867-0016 I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO HAVE HER WORD DOUBTED 
lbi-700-122867-0017 AND MISSUS ALLEN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUSPECT ANYONE OF NOT TELLING US THE TRUTH UNLESS WE HAVE PROOF THAT THEY'RE NOT 
lbi-700-122867-0018 BUT I HADN'T THEN AND I BELIEVED EVERY WORD HE SAID IMPLICITLY 
lbi-700-122867-0019 WHO SAID WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT 
lbi-700-122867-0020 OH I DIDN'T LET EM IN THE HOUSE 
lbi-700-122867-0021 IN A TRICE I SAW MYSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL RAVEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEMPTATION WAS IRRESISTIBLE 
lbi-700-122867-0022 OH MARILLA WHAT A TANGLED WEB WE WEAVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACTICE TO DECEIVE 
lbi-700-122867-0023 YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY HE CAN GO OUT WITHOUT LOOKING BACK 
lbi-700-122867-0024 WITH A DISMAL SIGH SHE WENT FOR THE SCISSORS 
lbi-700-122867-0025 BUT THERE'S NOTHING COMFORTING AND HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE HE DIED AT A DREADFUL COLOUR IS THERE 
lbi-700-122867-0026 AND WHEN TO WEEP ALL THE TIME YOU'RE CUTTING IT OFF IF IT WON'T INTERFERE 
lbi-700-122867-0027 IT SEEMED SUCH A TRAGIC THING 
lbi-700-122867-0028 AND WEPT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UPSTAIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE WAS CALM BUT A SPAN 
lbi-700-122867-0029 YES I WILL TOO 
lbi-700-122867-0030 I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS A VAIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SPITE OF ITS BEING READ BECAUSE IT IS SO LONG AND THICK AND CURLY 
lbi-700-122867-0031 I EXPECT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN TO MY NOSE NEXT 
lbi-700-122867-0032 AND CLEMENT HAD MADE A SENSATION IN SCHOOL THE FOLLOWING MONDAY BUT TO HER RELIEF NOBODY GUESSED THE REAL REASON FOR NOT HAVING JOSIE PYE WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FAIL TO INFORM ANNE THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCARECROW 
lbi-700-122867-0033 IT'S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SKIFF SCARE CROW AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK THAT I DID IT 
lbi-700-122867-0034 IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VIRTUOUS AND FORGIVE PEOPLE DOESN'T IT 
lbi-700-122867-0035 I MEAN TO DEVOTE ALL MY ENERGIES TO BE GOOD AFTER THIS AND I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN 
lbi-700-122867-0036 OF COURSE IT'S BETTER TO BE GOOD 
lbi-700-122867-0037 I DO REALLY WANT TO BEGAN REALLY TO LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALLAN AND MISS STACEY AND GOT TO BE A CREDIT TO YOU 
lbi-700-122867-0038 DINAH SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGINS TO GROW TO TIE A BLACK VELVET RIBBON AROUND MY HEAD WITH ABOUT ONE SIDE 
lbi-700-122867-0039 I WILL CALL IT A SNOOD THAT SOUND SO ROMANTIC 
lbi-700-122867-0040 MY HEAD IS BETTER NOW 
lbi-700-122867-0041 IT'S TERRIBLE BAD THIS AFTERNOON THOUGH 
lbi-700-122868-0000 OF COURSE YOU MUST BE ELAINE ANSWERED DIANA 
lbi-700-122868-0001 OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROMANTIC CONCEDED JANE ANDREWS BUT I KNOW THAT I COULDN'T KEEP STILL 
lbi-700-122868-0002 BUT IT'S SO RIDICULOUS TO HAVE A RED HEADED ELAINE MOURNED ANNE 
lbi-700-122868-0003 AND ELAINE WAS EASILY MADE 
lbi-700-122868-0004 YOUR COMPLEXION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RUBIES SAID DIANA EARNESTLY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT 
lbi-700-122868-0005 IT WAS SPLENDID TO FISH FOR CHAT OVER THE BEDS AND THE TWO GIRLS LEARN TO READ THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FLAT BOTTOMED DORY MISTER MERRICK FOR DUCK SHOOTING 
lbi-700-122868-0006 IT WAS ANNE'S EYES HAD THEY DRAMATIZE ELAINE 
lbi-700-122868-0007 THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROMANTIC THAN THE PRESENT 
lbi-700-122868-0008 THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT FOR PLAYING ELAINE 
lbi-700-122868-0009 THE BLACK SHAWL HAVING BEEN PROCURED AND SPREAD IT OVER THE FLAT AND THEN LAY DOWN IN THE BOTTOM WITH CLOSED EYES AND HANDS FOLDED OVER HER BREAST 
lbi-700-122868-0010 IT SPOILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS MASON WAS BORN 
lbi-700-122868-0011 JANE YOUR RANGES 
lbi-700-122868-0012 IT'S SILLY FOR ELAINE TO BE TALKING IN HIS DEN 
lbi-700-122868-0013 JANE ROSE TO THE OCCASION 
lbi-700-122868-0014 LEFT BEHIND AT THE LANDING 
lbi-700-122868-0015 AND GAVE ONE GASPING LITTLE SCREAM WHICH NOBODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LOSE HER SELF POSSESSION 
lbi-700-122868-0016 THERE IS ONE CHANCE JUST ONE 
lbi-700-122868-0017 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES YOU DON'T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLOWERY PRAIRIE 
lbi-700-122868-0018 THE LATTER DID UNDER THE BEDS AND THEN PROMPTLY SANK IN MID STREAM 
lbi-700-122868-0019 RUBY JANE AND DIANA ALREADY AWAITING IT ON THE LOWER HELEN SAW IT DISAPPEAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NO DOUBT OF THAT AND HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT 
lbi-700-122868-0020 THE MINUTES PASSED BY A SEEMING LIKE AN HOUR TO THE UNFORTUNATE LILLYMAN 
lbi-700-122868-0021 WHY DIDN'T SOMEBODY COME WHERE THE GIRLS GONE 
lbi-700-122868-0022 IMAGINATION BEGAN TO SUGGEST ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME POSSIBILITIES TO HER 
lbi-700-122868-0023 AND SURELY 
lbi-700-122868-0024 HOW ON EARTH DID YOU GET UP THERE HE EXCLAIMED 
lbi-700-122868-0025 IT WAS CERTAINLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO BE DIGNIFIED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES 
lbi-700-122868-0026 WHAT HAS HAPPENED ANNE 
lbi-700-122868-0027 ASKED GILBERT TAKING UP HIS OARS 
lbi-700-122868-0028 WE'RE PLAYING ELAINE EXPLAINED AND FRIGIDLY WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT HER RESCUER AND HAD TO DRIFT DOWN TO CAMELOT AND THE BARGE AND IN THE FIGHT 
lbi-700-122868-0029 FOR A MOMENT AND HESITATED 
lbi-700-122868-0030 HER HEART GAVE A QUICK QUEER LITTLE B 
lbi-700-122868-0031 HER RESENTMENT WHICH TO OTHER AND OLDER PEOPLE MIGHT BE AS LAUGHABLE AS ITS CAUSE WAS NO WHIT ALLAYED AND SOFTENED BY TIME SOOTHINGLY 
lbi-700-122868-0032 NO SHE SAID COLDLY I SHALL NEVER BE FRIENDS WITH YOU GILBERT BLYTHE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE 
lbi-700-122868-0033 ALL RIGHT 
lbi-700-122868-0034 I'LL NEVER ASK YOU TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN AND SURELY I DON'T CARE EITHER 
lbi-700-122868-0035 OF COURSE HE HAD INSULTED HER TERRIBLY BUT STILL 
lbi-700-122868-0036 EVERYTHING I DO GET ME ARE MY DEAREST FRIENDS AND TO ESCAPE 
lbi-700-122868-0037 AND POOR SENTIMENT PROVED MORE TRUSTWORTHY THAN OUR SENTIMENTS ARE APT TO DO 
lbi-700-122868-0038 WILL YOU EVER HAVE ANY SENSE AND GRIM MARILLA 
lbi-700-122868-0039 I DON'T SEE HOW SAID MARILLA 
lbi-700-122868-0040 EVER SINCE I CAME TO GREEN GABLES I'VE BEEN MAKING MISTAKES AND EACH ESTATE HAS HELPED TO CURE ME OF SOME GREAT SHORTCOMING 
lbi-7601-101619-0000 OUR EXTREMEST PLEASURE HAS SOME SORT OF GROANING AND COMPLAINING IN IT WOULD YOU NOT SAY THAT IT IS DYING OF PAIN 
lbi-7601-101619-0001 THE HIGHEST AND FULLEST CONTENTMENT OFFERS MORE THE GRAVE NONE OF THE MERRY IPSA FELICITOUS SANE TEMPERATE PERMIT EVEN FELICITY UNLESS AT MODERATE ITSELF OPPRESSORS 
lbi-7601-101619-0002 SOCRATES SAYS THAT SOME GOD TRIED TO MIX IN ONE MASS AND A CONFOUNDED PAIN AND PLEASURE BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DO IT HE BETHOUGHT HIM AT LEAST TO COUPLE THEM BY A TALE METRODORUS SAID THAT IN SORROW THERE SOME MIXTURE OF PLEASURE 
lbi-7601-101619-0003 NATURE DISCOVERS THIS CONFUSION TOURISTS PAINTERS HOLDETH THE SAME MOTIONS AND GRIMACES OF THE FACE THAT SERVE FOR WEEPING SERVE FOR LAUGHTER TOO AND INDEED BEFORE THE ONE OR THE OTHER BE FINISHED DO BUT OBSERVE THE PAINTER'S MANNER OF HANDLING AND YOU WILL BE IN DOUBT TO WHICH OF THE TWO THE DESIGN TENS AND THE EXTREME OF LAUGHTER DOES AT LAST BRING TEARS 
lbi-7601-101619-0004 AND THEREFORE COMMON ENDLESS SPECULATIVE SOULS ARE FOUND TO BE MORE PROPER FOR A MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AFFAIRS AND THE ELEVATED AND EXQUISITE OPINIONS OF PHILOSOPHY UNFIT FOR BUSINESS THE SHARP VIVACITY A SOUL AND THE SUPPLE AND RESTLESS VOLUBILITY ATTENDING IT DISTURB OUR NEGOTIATIONS 
lbi-7601-101619-0005 HE WHO DIES IN TWO AND IN HIS INQUISITION COMPREHENDS ALL CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES HINDERS HIS ELECTION A LITTLE ENGINE WELL HANDLED IS SUFFICIENT FOR EXECUTIONS WHETHER OF LESS OR GREATER WEIGHT 
lbi-7601-101622-0000 THE ROMANS BY THIS MEANS DIRECTED THEIR COLONIES FOR PERCEIVING THEIR CITY TO GROW IMMEASURABLY POPULACE THEY EMERGED OUT OF THE MOST UNNECESSARY PEOPLE AND SENT THEM TO INHABIT AND CULTIVATE THE LANDS CONQUERED BY THEM SOMETIMES ALSO THEY PURPOSELY MAINTAIN WARS WITH SOME OF THEIR ENEMIES NOT ONLY TO KEEP THEIR OWN MEN IN ACTION FOR FEAR LEST IDLENESS IS THE MOTHER OF CORRUPTION SHOULD BRING UPON THEM SOME WORSE INCONVENIENCE 
lbi-7601-101622-0001 AND LUCIA FOR THE ILLS OF A LONG PEACE LUXURY IS MORE PERNICIOUS THAN WAR 
lbi-7601-101622-0002 AND THIS ALSO WAS ONE REASON WHY OUR KING PHILIP CONSENTED TO SEND HIS SON JOHN OF PARMA FOR AN EXPEDITION THAT HE MIGHT TAKE ALONG WITH HIM A GREAT NUMBER OF HOT YOUNG MEN WHO WERE THEN IN HIS PAY 
lbi-7601-101622-0003 WHAT OTHER END WAS THE IMPERIOUS ARTER THE GLADIATORS PROPOSED TO ITSELF WHAT A SLAUGHTER OF YOUNG MEN WHAT PLEASURE FED WITH BLOND 
lbi-7601-101622-0004 PRINCE TAKE YONDER'S DELAYED FOR THY REIGN AND BE SUCCESSOR TO THY FATHER'S HENCEFORTH LET NONE AT ROME BE SLAIN FOR SPORT 
lbi-7601-101622-0005 LET BEAST'S BLOOD STAIN AND FOOLISH ARENA AND NO MORE HOMICIDE BE THERE ACTED 
lbi-7601-101622-0006 IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR A FIGHT AND DIED BRAVELY BUT CHEERFULLY TO INSOMUCH THAT THEY WERE HISSED AND CURSED IF THEY MADE ANY HESITATION ABOUT RECEIVING THEIR DEATH 
lbi-7601-101622-0007 THE VERY GIRLS THEMSELVES SET THEM ON 
lbi-7601-175351-0000 BEGINNING OF REVOLT 
lbi-7601-175351-0001 AT THIS UNEXPECTED COMMAND SURPRISE WAS GREAT ON BOARD THE FORWARD 
lbi-7601-175351-0002 LIGHT THE FIRES EXCLAIMED SOME 
lbi-7601-175351-0003 OR WITH US TO OTHERS 
lbi-7601-175351-0004 AND STUFFED THE STOVE WITH THE MASTS ADDED WARREN 
lbi-7601-175351-0005 DID YOU HEAR ME 
lbi-7601-175351-0006 WHO SPOKE CRIED HATTERAS 
lbi-7601-175351-0007 I DID SAID PEN ADVANCING TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN 
lbi-7601-175351-0008 I SAY ANSWERED PEN WITH AN OATH I SAY WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AND WE WON'T GO ANY FURTHER 
lbi-7601-175351-0009 YOU SHAN'T KILL US WITH HUNGER AND WORK IN THE WINTER AND THEY SHALL LIGHT THE FIRES 
lbi-7601-175351-0010 IF YOU REPEAT WHAT THE MAN SAYS ANSWERED HATTERAS I'LL HAVE YOU SHUT UP IN YOUR CABIN UNGUARDED 
lbi-7601-175351-0011 A MURMUR WAS HEARD 
lbi-7601-175351-0012 THE ENGINEER FOLLOWED BY CLOVER AND ONE WENT DOWN TO HIS POST 
lbi-7601-175351-0013 THE STEAM WAS SOON GOT UP THE ANCHORS WERE WEIGHED AND THE FORWARD VEERED AWAY EAST CUTTING THE YOUNG IRISH WITH HER STEEL PROW 
lbi-7601-175351-0014 BETWEEN BERING ISLAND AND BEECHER POINT THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF ISLANDS IN THE MIDST OF ICE FIELDS THE STREAMS CROWD TOGETHER IN THE LITTLE TROUSERS WHICH CUT UP DISH POUR THE SEA THEY HAD A TENDENCY TO AGGLOMERATE UNDER THE RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE HUMMOCKS WERE FORMED HERE AND THERE AND THESE MASSES ALREADY MORE COMPACT DENSER AND CLOSER TOGETHER WOULD SOON FORM AN IMPENETRABLE MASS 
lbi-7601-175351-0015 I'M BEGINNING NOT TO ANSWERED WILL 
lbi-7601-175351-0016 HATTERAS STILL HOPED TO FIND AN OPEN SEA BEYOND THE SEVENTY SEVENTH PARALLEL OF SIR EDWARD BELCHER HAD DONE 
lbi-7601-175351-0017 OUGHT HE TO TREAT THESE ACCOUNTS AS APOCRYPHAL 
lbi-7601-175351-0018 THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SET FOR THE FIRST TIME ENDING THUS THE LONG SERIES OF DAYS WAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS IN THEM 
lbi-7601-175351-0019 THE MEN HAD ENDED BY GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE CONTINUAL DAYLIGHT BUT IT HAD NEVER MADE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE ANIMALS THE GREENLAND DOGS WON'T THEY RUSHED AT THE ACCUSTOMED HOUR AND DICK SLEPT AS REGULARLY EVERY EVENING AND SO DARKNESS HAD COVERED THE SKY 
lbi-7601-175351-0020 THE DOCTOR BY FOLLOWING JOHNSON'S ADVICE ACCUSTOMED HIMSELF TO SUPPORT A LOW TEMPERATURE HE ALMOST ALWAYS STAYED ON DECK ROVING THE COLD THE WIND AND THE SNOW 
lbi-7601-175351-0021 THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AMONGST US WHO WOULD LIKE TO IMITATE THEM I THINK 
lbi-7601-175351-0022 THEY ARE COWARDS MISTER CLAUDE MONET THOSE ANIMALS HAVE NO PROVISIONS AS WE HAVE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK THEIR FOOD WERE IT IS TO BE FOUND 
lbi-7601-175351-0023 YOU HOPED THAT HATTERAS WILL SUCCEED THEN 
lbi-7601-175351-0024 HE CERTAINLY WILL MUSTER CALL BONEY 
lbi-7601-175351-0025 I'M OF THE SAME OPINION AS YOU JOHNSON AND IF YOU ONLY WANTED ONE FAITHFUL COMPANION HE'LL HAVE TO 
lbi-7601-175351-0026 PRINCE ALBERT LAND WHICH THE FOREIGNERS THEN COASTING BEARS ALSO THE NAME OF GRINNELL LAND AND THOUGH HATTERAS FROM HIS HATRED TO THE YANKEES WOULD NEVER CALL IT BY ITS AMERICAN NAME IT IS THE ONE GENERALLY GOES BY 
lbi-7601-175351-0027 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF AUGUST THEY SIGHTED BRITANNIA MOUNTAIN SCARCELY VISIBLE THROUGH THE MIST AND THE FORWARD WEIGHED ANCHOR THE NEXT DAY IN NORTHUMBERLAND BAY 
lbi-7601-291468-0000 WHEN THE LOFTY SOCIAL STUDIES IS ABOUT TO ENTER UPON HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE PLAGUE THAT DESOLATED ATHENS OR NERVOUS MODERN COMMENTATORS ASSURE THE READER THAT THE HISTORY IS NOW GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY SOLEMN SERIOUS AND PATHETIC UNHINGE WITH THAT AIR OF CHUCKLING GRATULATION WITH WHICH GOOD DAME DRAWS FORTH A CHOICE MORSEL FROM A CUPBOARD TO REGALE A FAVORITE THIS DISH PLAGUE WILL GIVE HIS HISTORY A MOST AGREEABLE VARIETY 
lbi-7601-291468-0001 SUCH ARE THE TRUE SUBJECTS FOR THE HISTORIC PEN 
lbi-7601-291468-0002 THE FALL OF EMPIRES THE DESOLATION OF HAPPY COUNTRIES SPLENDID CITIES SMOKING IN THE RUINS THE PROUDEST WORKS OF ART TUMBLED IN THE DUST THE SHRIEKS AND GROANS OF WHOLE NATIONS ASCENDING INTO HEAVEN 
lbi-7601-291468-0003 THUS THOSE SWARMS OF FLIES WHICH ARE SO OFTEN EXECRATED AS USELESS VERMIN ARE CREATED FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF SPIDERS AND SPIDERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE EVIDENTLY MADE TO DEVOUR FLIES 
lbi-7601-291468-0004 ANCIENT TRADITIONS SPEAK MUCH OF HIS LEARNING AND OF THE GALLANT INROADS HE HAD MADE INTO THE DEAD LANGUAGES IN WHICH SHE HAD MADE CAPTIVE A HOST OF GREEK NOUNS AND LATIN VERBS AND BROUGHT OFF A RICH BOOTY IN ANCIENT SAWS AN APOSTLE TERMS WHICH HE WAS WONT TO PARADE IN HIS PUBLIC HARANGUES AS A TRIUMPHANT JOURNAL OF YORE HIS SPOLIA OPIMA 
lbi-7601-291468-0005 IT WAS OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT HE SELDOM GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT WITHOUT GETTING INTO A PERPLEXITY AND THEN INTO A PASSION WITH HIS ADVERSARY FOR NOT BEING CONVINCED GRATIS 
lbi-7601-291468-0006 HIS ABODE WHICH HE HAD FIXED IN A BOWERY OR COUNTRY SEAT AT A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE CITY JUST AT WHAT IS NOW CALLED DUTCH STREET SOON ABOUNDED WITH PROOFS OF HIS INGENUITY PATENT SMOKE JACKS THAT REQUIRED A HORSE TO WORK SOME DUTCH OVENS THAT ROASTED MEAT WITHOUT FIRE CARTS THAT WENT BEFORE THE HORSES WEATHERCOCKS TURNED AGAINST THE WIND AND OTHER WRONG HEADED CONTRIVANCES THAT ASTONISHED AND CONFOUNDED ALL BEHOLDERS 
lbi-7601-291468-0007 IT IS IN KNOWLEDGE AS IN SWIMMING HE WHO FLOUNDERS AND SPLASHES ON THE SURFACE MUCH MORE NOISE AND ATTRACT MORE ATTENTION THAN THE PEARL DIVER WHO QUIETLY DIVERSION IN QUEST OF TREASURE TO THE BOTTOM 
lbi-7641-96252-0000 THUS WHEN DOGMAS NEEDED WHAT THE MAN REALLY AND IN GENERAL WILLS REMAINED STILL THE SAME 
lbi-7641-96252-0001 FOR THESE ARE CAREFUL ONLY FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR OWN EGOISM JUST LIKE A BANDAGE FROM WHOM THEY ARE ONLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE ABSURDITY OF THEIR MEANS 
lbi-7641-96252-0002 THE DEEDS AND CONDUCT OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND THE NATION MAY BE VERY MUCH MODIFIED TO DOUGLAS EXAMPLE AND CUSTOM 
lbi-7641-96252-0003 WITH AN EQUAL DEGREE OF WICKEDNESS ONE MAN MAY DIE ON THE WHEEL AND ANOTHER IN THE BOSOM OF HIS FAMILY 
lbi-7641-96252-0004 IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT PERFECT STATE OR PERHAPS INDEED A COMPLETE AND FIRMLY BELIEVED DOCTRINE OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS AFTER DEATH MIGHT PREVENT EVERY CRIME POLITICALLY MUCH WOULD BE GAINED THEREBY MERRILY NOTHING ONLY AN EXPRESSION OF THE WILL IN LIFE WILL BE RESTRICTED 
lbi-7641-96252-0005 WE HOOSIERS SEEKS THE THEORY OF VIRTUE AND HAVE THEREFORE ALL SUCH EXPRESS ABSTRACTLY THE NATURE OF THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH LIES AT ITS FOUNDATION WILL YET BE UNABLE TO CONVEY THE KNOWLEDGE ITSELF IN EXPRESSION 
lbi-7641-96252-0006 HE SEES THAT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HIMSELF AND OTHERS WHICH TO THE BAD MAN IS SO GREAT OF GROWTH ONLY BELONGS TO A FLEETING AND ELUSIVE PHENOMENON 
lbi-7641-96252-0007 HE RECOGNIZES HIMSELF HIS WILL IN EVERY BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO IN THE SUFFERER 
lbi-7641-96252-0008 THE LATTER IS THE NECESSARY AND INEVITABLE SYMPTOM OF THAT KNOWLEDGE 
lbi-7641-96252-0009 THE OPPOSITE OF THE STING OF CONSCIENCE THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH IS EXPLAINED ABOVE IS A GOOD CONSCIENCE THE SATISFACTION WHICH WE EXPERIENCE AFTER EVERY DISINTERESTED DEED 
lbi-7641-96252-0010 THE GOOD MAN LIVES IN A WORLD OF FRIENDLY INDIVIDUALS THE WELL BEING OF ANY OF WHOM HE REGARDED AS HIS OWN 
lbi-7641-96252-0011 THEREFORE ALTHOUGH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOT OF MANKIND GENERALLY DOES NOT MAKE ITS DISPOSITION A JOYFUL AND YET THE PERMANENT KNOWLEDGE OF HIS OWN NATURE ALL LIVING BEINGS GIVES HIM A CERTAIN EVENNESS AND EVEN SERENITY OF DISPOSITION 
lbi-7641-96252-0012 FOR THE INTEREST WHICH IS EXTENDED TO INNUMERABLE MANIFESTATIONS CANNOT CAUSE SUCH ANXIETY AS THAT WHICH IS CONCENTRATED UPON ONE 
lbi-7641-96252-0013 THE ACCIDENTS WHICH CONCERNED INDIVIDUALS COLLECTIVELY EQUALISED THEMSELVES WHILE THOSE WHICH HAPPENED TO THE PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTE GOOD OR BAD FORTUNE 
lbi-7641-96252-0014 THUS THOUGH OTHERS HAVE SET UP MORAL PRINCIPLES WHICH THEY GIVE OUT AS PRESCRIPTIONS FOR VIRTUE AND LAWS WHICH IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOLLOW I AS HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID CANNOT DO THIS BECAUSE I HAVE NO ART OR LARGE PRESCRIBED IN THE ETERNALLY FREEWILL 
lbi-7641-96252-0015 FURTHER THAN THIS IT CANNOT GO FOR THERE EXISTS NO REASON FOR AN INDIVIDUALITY OF ANOTHER TO HIS OWN 
lbi-7641-96252-0016 YET THE NUMBER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHOLE HAPPINESS OR LIFE IS IN DANGER MAY OUTWEIGH THE REGARD FOR ONE'S OWN PARTICULAR WELLBEING 
lbi-7641-96252-0017 SODA SOCRATES AND GIORDANO BRUNO AND SO MANY A HERO SHOULD SUFFER DEATH AT THE STAKE AT THE HAND OF THE PRINCE 
lbi-7641-96252-0018 WEEPING IS ACCORDINGLY SYMPATHY WITH OUR OWN SELVES ARE SIMPLY DIRECTED BACK ON ITS SOURCE 
lbi-7641-96252-0019 IT IS THEREFORE CONDITIONAL UPON THE CAPACITY FOR LOVE AND SYMPATHY AND ALSO UPON IMAGINATION 
lbi-7641-96252-0020 WHEN WE ARE MOVED TO TEARS NOT THROUGH OUR OWN SUFFERING BUT THROUGH THAT OF ANOTHER THIS HAPPENS AS FOLLOWS 
lbi-7641-96252-0021 EITHER WE VIVIDLY PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE THE SUFFERER BY IMAGINATION OR SEEING HIS FATE THE LOT OF HUMANITY AS A WHOLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FIRST OF ALL ARE ON THE SPOT AND THUS IN A VERY ROUNDABOUT WAY AS YET ALWAYS ABOUT OURSELVES THAT WE WEEP SYMPATHY WITH OURSELVES WHICH WE FEEL THIS SEEMS TO BE THE PRINCIPAL REASON OF THE UNIVERSAL AND THUS NATURAL WEEPING IN THE CASE OF DEATH 
lbi-7641-96252-0022 FIRST OF ALL HE CERTAINLY GROUPS FOR THE FATE OF THE DEAD BUT HE ALSO WEEPS WHEN AFTER LONG HEAVY AND INCURABLE SUFFERING DEATH WAS TO THIS MAN OR WISH FOR DELIVERANCE 
lbi-7641-96670-0000 THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS FEEBLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SKY 
lbi-7641-96670-0001 AND MANY OF THE MAGICIANS OF EGYPT WHO HAD COME WAS KING SESOSTRIS STAYED IN THAT CITY AND THEY ARE AND THEY TALK PEOPLE SPELLS THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN THE RISING AND SETTING 
lbi-7641-96670-0002 MEDIA TO HIS WISE DAUGHTER KNEW ITS SECRETS TAUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SWAY THE MOON 
lbi-7641-96670-0003 FOR JASON WAS A GRANDSON OF CRASSUS AND CRASSUS WAS THE BROTHER OF THE FAMOUS THEIR GRANDFATHER 
lbi-7641-96670-0004 JASON TOOK PELEUS AND TOM ON WITH HIM 
lbi-7641-96670-0005 AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND JASON AND HIS COMRADES WITH THE SONGS OF FRANCIS WENT TO THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN 
lbi-7641-96670-0006 THE MIST LIFTED AND BEFORE THE HEROES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PALACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING 
lbi-7641-96670-0007 ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURTYARD WHERE THE PALACE BUILDINGS IN ONE KEEN AND SLUICE ABSYRTUS HIS SON AND ANY OTHER CHALCIOPE AND MEDEIA LIVED WITH TWO HANDMAIDENS 
lbi-7641-96670-0008 AND THEN A DOVE FLEW TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CHASED BY A HAWK AND MEDEA SAW THE HAWK'S EYES AND BEAK 
lbi-7641-96670-0009 WE PULLED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THEREAFTER WE WERE DRIVEN BY THE WIND BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE FAUCES 
lbi-7641-96670-0010 WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE 
lbi-7641-96670-0011 ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SARMON 
lbi-7641-96670-0012 HE WITH HIS COMRADES WILL SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU 
lbi-7641-96670-0013 AND HIS HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES 
lbi-7641-96670-0014 THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID 
lbi-7641-96670-0015 HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIALS HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM 
lbi-7641-96670-0016 IT MAY BE THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE SEAT OF THE IMMORTALS 
lbi-7641-96670-0017 AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I'VE MADE TRIAL OF YOU 
lbi-7641-96670-0018 SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM 
lbi-7641-96670-0019 SHE HAD A DARK FACES MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR 
lbi-7641-96670-0020 NO DOUBT ON THE PLANE OF VARIOUS YONDER I HAVE TO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET ABREAST 
lbi-7641-96670-0021 THEN I SHOWED THE FURROWS NOTWITHSTANDING THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON 
lbi-7641-96670-0022 IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE 
lbi-7641-96670-0023 BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD UP TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE 
lbi-7641-96670-0024 THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND 
lbi-7641-96670-0025 I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS AS IT IS 
lbi-7641-96670-0026 AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDIA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR 
lbi-7641-96670-0027 TROCHUS MOUSE WENT WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS 
lbi-7641-96684-0000 DOES IMMORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN 
lbi-7641-96684-0001 AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED ADDED MENACES EVER SMILING FACE AND NEVER FADING GREEN 
lbi-7641-96684-0002 THOSE BEFORE ADMITTING SAILED ON OUR GO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST 
lbi-7641-96684-0003 THEREAFTER MEADOWS HAVING LOVE OF ALKESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE 
lbi-7641-96684-0004 A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN 
lbi-7641-96684-0005 BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE WITHOUT JOY 
lbi-7641-96684-0006 WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINDFUL APOLLO'S YOUR YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMETUS 
lbi-7641-96684-0007 BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY 
lbi-7641-96684-0008 HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMIT US 
lbi-7641-96684-0009 ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH 
lbi-7641-96684-0010 IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WHERE HAVE YOU COME TO MEND MATTERS AND LET US KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU 
lbi-7641-96684-0011 IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY AND THAT PLACE WAS DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS 
lbi-7641-96684-0012 THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON THE STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES 
lbi-7641-96684-0013 THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH THEIR EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN A MATTED HAIR 
lbi-7641-96684-0014 SHE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH 
lbi-7641-96684-0015 BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH'S HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER 
lbi-7641-96684-0016 ADAM ADAMS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELLED HAND AND ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GOETHE DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM 
lbi-7641-96684-0017 THEN A TREMENDOUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES ROUND HOUSE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE 
lbi-7641-96684-0018 ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE KEEN AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO 
lbi-7641-96684-0019 NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP 
lbi-7641-96684-0020 IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE 
lbi-7641-96684-0021 AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE 
lbi-7641-96684-0022 DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER 
lbi-7641-96684-0023 NO NOT HERE FOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COMING TO THE PALACE 
lbi-7641-96684-0024 HE LIFTED ALCESTIS STRUNG BED AND CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE 
lbi-7641-96684-0025 NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM HER 
lbi-7641-96684-0026 AND AS FOR ADMITTANCE HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH A CUSTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS 
lbi-7641-96684-0027 TO WHAT GOD HAS THUS SACRIFICED DOOM 
lbi-7641-96684-0028 THEN ROCKLEY'S FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOUR WAS BEFORE HIM 
lbi-7641-96684-0029 I'VE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUNDS OF GOD KNOWS WHOM DESPERATION SOUND INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD 
lbi-7641-96684-0030 WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH 
lbi-7641-96684-0031 AND WHAT A NOBLE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND 
lbi-7641-96684-0032 HE LEFT THE PALACE AT MEMPHIS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS 
lbi-7641-96684-0033 YOU ARE HELD BY MEET US AND WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS SAMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU 
lbi-7641-96684-0034 AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLIUS COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF SHE WERE HELD PROMISE THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRING ONE WITH HIM 
lbi-7641-96684-0035 SHE WAS VEILED AND MENACE COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES 
lbi-7641-96684-0036 HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY 
lbi-7641-96684-0037 THIS I CANNOT DO STERN MENACE I'VE HAD PAINS ENOUGH 
lbi-7641-96684-0038 THEN A TREMENDOUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE 
lbi-7697-105815-0000 HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AND A DOOR WHICH HE WAS NOT VISITED TWO OR THREE TIMES 
lbi-7697-105815-0001 CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE A GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE 
lbi-7697-105815-0002 CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND I'M ON MY WAY TO MONSEIGNEUR 
lbi-7697-105815-0003 I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN WHO STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IT FAR FROM HERE YOU SHOW ME THE THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME 
lbi-7697-105815-0004 HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD LEAVE RAIMENT AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG OVER HIS HEAD 
lbi-7697-105815-0005 CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN 
lbi-7697-105815-0006 THEN HE TOOK ME INTO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SLEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT 
lbi-7697-105815-0007 FOR CERTAIN WHAT MEANS THIS 
lbi-7697-105815-0008 THEY NEXT SAW THE MAID COMING DELIGHTED US SO UNSEEMLY AND LAID LOW BY BATHING LUKE 
lbi-7697-105815-0009 JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP DID IT ROUSE A SLOW SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE 
lbi-7697-105815-0010 AS HE STUDIED THOSE UNWEPT LOW THREE RIFLE WAS EMPTY AND ONE OF THEM SAY PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SCENES 
lbi-7697-105815-0011 CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SAID AS HE WENT ON WHAT A PLAZES BLAST THRALE'S BEST TOO 
lbi-7697-105815-0012 HE WENT ON THOSE WHO COME TO BAY WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE SOME SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET 
lbi-7697-105815-0013 REASON SAYS BRANSCOMBE YOU AND WHERE DO WE GO 
lbi-7697-105815-0014 FOR MALICE AND HYPOCRISY WAVE OR IN THE LAND OF GLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZION FOR PRAISE 
lbi-7697-105815-0015 NO NOT THE HATE THAT COMES NODDING AT THE DOOR WITH CLUBS AFTER GETTING THE SAME AS A THIEF 
lbi-7697-105815-0016 THEY TOOK CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE OF THE STORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE A LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THE ABBES OF REVIEWS 
lbi-7697-105815-0017 YES SIR NO DOUBT OF IT 
lbi-7697-105815-0018 AND IF WE'RE GETTING TO RODIN AH PRAY WHAT ARE YOURS 
lbi-7697-105815-0019 NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS 
lbi-7697-105815-0020 I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HERO OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING 
lbi-7697-105815-0021 NOW UNCHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DESCENDED AND THE WINDS OF VIEW 
lbi-7697-105815-0022 NOW HALFWAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LAW THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY THE RIVER

lbi-7697-105815-0033 HE LAID IT IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD

lbi-7697-105815-0051 AND THEY BROUGHT OUT A JAW BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON TO SUCH WORTHIES AND SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GOLIATH OF GATH 
lbi-7697-105815-0052 WAS THE NAME OF THIS SUSPICION 
lbi-7697-105815-0053 THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS A MAN WHOSE THEN 
lbi-7697-105817-0000 MORGAN IS HAPPY HER RAID ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE

lbi-7697-105817-0004 COME GOOD HELPFUL SECRETION LET US WALK ON THE GRASS 
lbi-7697-105817-0005 SO THEY SENT A THIRD VIEW 
lbi-7697-105817-0006 OH I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT HERE ISN'T YOUR FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH 
lbi-7697-105817-0007 I WILL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD 
lbi-7697-105817-0008 WHO SHOULD WE MUST NOW STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK 
lbi-7697-105817-0009 THEN SUBJOINED DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE 
lbi-7697-105817-0010 THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE BORN 
lbi-7697-105817-0011 AND BY HIS ACT REGARD OURSELVES AS WELL 
lbi-7697-245712-0000 OR WHETHER IN THE STATE MAY HAVE BEEN MISTER ROUMANN 
lbi-7697-245712-0001 THEREFORE INSTEAD OF INNOCENT MEN HAVE NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS 
lbi-7697-245712-0002 THEREFORE IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MILETUS BADE NOTHINGNESS BADEN THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM 
lbi-7697-245712-0003 CERTAINLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH AULUS GABINIUS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR 
lbi-7697-245712-0004 CERTAINLY DISAPPROVE FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OTHER ANIMALS 
lbi-7697-245712-0005 NOW WHATEVER'S PARTICIPATE IN ITS OBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL 
lbi-7697-245712-0006 THEREFORE THIS JUNCTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL 
lbi-7697-245712-0007 THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ALL THIS CAN HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MAN AS NEITHER AT REST NOR THEY FOR THAT REASON EXCEPT FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD AS PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED OFFICE 
lbi-7697-245712-0008 THIS IS CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED THE ANIMALS TO MEN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THE NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES 
lbi-7697-245712-0009 SO I GUESS WE'LL HAVE A BIT MORE VIRILE COURT AS IN THE PRESENT DAY SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM 
lbi-7697-245712-0010 OBJECTION WHEN IT SEEMED THAT ANY SAVE INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES 
lbi-7697-245712-0011 MUCH LESS FAVORABLE TO HAVE A BIG MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE 
lbi-7697-245712-0012 THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY THIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT MASTERSHIP ESTEEMS FRETTING THE STEVENSONS MANHANDLED MAIDEN OVER PLANS 
lbi-7697-245712-0013 NOW WE MAY REASON HAST POSITION OF MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT 
lbi-7697-245712-0014 I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN A PRIMITIVE STATE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SUCH A UNION HAVE BEEN STERILE 
lbi-7697-245712-0015 THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY 
lbi-7697-245712-0016 INEQUALITY MILES ARISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE 
lbi-7697-245712-0017 OBJECTION ONE IT WAS CERTAIN THAT MISTER LEWES'S MOUNT NOT HAPPY MISTER ERMINE 
lbi-7697-245712-0018 THEREFORE IN A STATE OF INNOCENCE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN 
lbi-7697-245712-0019 IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN PAST THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREEMEN CAN BECOME A MASTER 
lbi-7697-245712-0020 SUCH A CALM OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS 
lbi-7697-245715-0000 BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THEY WERE UNHAPPY LONELINESS OF OLD AGE 
lbi-7697-245715-0001 ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED INTERESTING PERFECT BUT IN THE CITY COUSINS CHILDREN WOULD HAVE A FORGOTTEN GENERATION 
lbi-7697-245715-0002 THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT IN BOTANY SIZE AND POWER 
lbi-7697-245715-0003 THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORNE ON THE CONTRARY NATURES PRESENT GENERATION HAPPENING HARMONIES MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD 
lbi-8173-294714-0000 I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID 
lbi-8173-294714-0001 AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT US HELPLESS

lbi-8173-294714-0003 HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US 
lbi-8173-294714-0004 EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENSIVE AND BRANT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY 
lbi-8173-294714-0005 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAN A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE WAS A MAN WHOM SHE LOVES 
lbi-8173-294714-0006 SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE

lbi-8173-294714-0012 IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHOSE PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL AS MY CHILD 
lbi-8173-294714-0013 AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID 
lbi-8173-294714-0014 IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS A CHILD CRY SHE REPEATED 
lbi-8173-294714-0015 IN SUCH A POSITION AS MINE

lbi-8173-294714-0017 AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD AND SHELTER 
lbi-8173-294714-0018 AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE'S NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD 
lbi-8173-294714-0019 BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY 
lbi-8173-294714-0020 MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE 
lbi-8173-294714-0021 THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD IN THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS 
lbi-8173-294714-0022 THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY 
lbi-8173-294714-0023 NOW WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF

lbi-8173-294714-0025 I YIELDED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE 
lbi-8173-294714-0026 EVERY WORD SHE UTTERED ONLY INCREASED MY ADMIRATION OF THE NOBLE CREATURE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST 
lbi-8173-294714-0027 BITTERLY AS I HATED THE MAN WHO HAD PARTED US AND LOVED HER DEARLY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAPABLE OF HELPING HIM FOR HER SAKE HOPELESS INFATUATION 
lbi-8173-294714-0028 I DON'T DENY IT I DON'T EXCUSE IT HOPELESS INFATUATION YOU HAVE FORGIVEN ME I SAID 
lbi-8173-294714-0029 LET ME DESERVE TO BE FORGIVEN

lbi-8173-294714-0031 YOU MUST HAVE PLANS FOR THE FUTURE TELL ME UNRESERVEDLY HOW I CAN HELP YOU

lbi-8173-294714-0041 YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT 
lbi-8173-294714-0042 UNHAPPILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORTUNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARRESTED FOR DEBT 
lbi-8173-294714-0043 THE SNARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAINLY REVEALED IN THOSE FOUR WORDS 
lbi-8173-294714-0044 IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SINGLE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES HER OWN MISTRESS 
lbi-8173-294714-0045 WHAT WAS THERE TO PREVENT HER FROM INSURING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASED AND FROM SO DISPOSING OF THE INSURANCE OFFICE TO GIVE AND BRETON DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH

lbi-8254-115543-0020 AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GREAT CLOUD OF DUST DOWN THE ROAD 
lbi-8254-115543-0021 I DON'T DOUBT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWERFUL RAJAH GOING STAY ON A JOURNEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RAJAH OR RULER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KINGDOMS OR STATES OF WHICH MARTIN AND DEAL AS FORMERLY MAIDA

lbi-8254-115543-0027 AND ALL THE REST OF THE DAY LITTLE FOLK TALKED OF NOTHING BUT A GREAT AUNT JANICE ESCORT 
lbi-8254-115543-0028 OUR PARTY CAME TO A HALT AMONG MANY OTHER BULLOCK CARTS THE OWNERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND COOKING THEIR SUPPERS OF BARGAINING FOR FOOD AND A LITTLE BLUE

lbi-8254-84205-0053 THERE HE SAID I'VE MADE UP MY MIND 
lbi-8254-84205-0054 IT IS VERY EVIDENT THAT WE WAIT HERE TO OUR STORES ARE EXHAUSTED AND BE AS FAR OFF THE OPPORTUNITY AS SICK AS EVER 
lbi-8254-84205-0055 THE INDIANS CAN WAIT WE CANNOT THEY SEEM TO KNOW IT 
lbi-8254-84205-0056 GOING TO GIVE UP YOUNG ACTRESSES WHEN THAT EXPLOSION 
lbi-8254-84205-0057 NO I'M GOING TO PUT IN FORCE AT ONCE WE START TONIGHT

lbi-8254-84205-0060 VISIONS CAN BE PACKED IN A WALLET THAT EVERYTHING ALL READY FOR A START 
lbi-8254-84205-0061 FINALLY JUST AS THE ANIMALS COULD BE DRIVEN INTO FOOD WATER AND 
lbi-8254-84205-0062 EXACTLY SO REPLIED THE DOCTOR 
lbi-8254-84205-0063 BUT BEFORE ANY MORE SAID KATE I WANT TO OFFER YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRAW BACK 
lbi-8254-84205-0064 WHAT FOR SAID RUTH SHARPLY

lbi-8254-84205-0067 THERE'S A HORRIBLE SIGHT CAKES 
lbi-8254-84205-0068 WHAT BEINGS LET THEM GET THE BETTER OF US SIR 
lbi-8254-84205-0069 YOU MEAN THE SHUTTING UP THE ENEMIES OR TO STARVE 
lbi-8254-84205-0070 JACOPO DE CAKES SO SHARPLY THAT THE BOY STARTED SERVE HIM RIGHT IF THEY DID SIR 
lbi-8254-84205-0071 WHAT BUSINESS HAVE THEY TO WANT OUR SCALPS BUT WE SHUT THEM UP TO STARVE 
lbi-8254-84205-0072 THEY'D HAVE WEEKS OF WORK BEFORE THEY COULD GET THE HORSES OUT THERE WITH THE HORSES THEY BE OUT AND AWAY 
lbi-8254-84205-0073 STAR NONSENSE 
lbi-8254-84205-0074 BUT THERE I DON'T WANT TO MAKE SPEECHES AS A THOROUGH GENTLEMAN 
lbi-8254-84205-0075 BUT YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK OUT WITH COMING OFF 
lbi-8254-84205-0076 NOW EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT HE IS TO BE READY WITHOUT SHOWING ANY WATCHFUL INDIAN SCOUT THERE'S SOMETHING ON THE WAY 
lbi-1585-131718-0000 WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT A CAPITALIST BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THREADS WOVEN NEIGHING AND FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH UNTIL A CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE CHARACTER OF THE RUINS CAN BE SEEN 
lbi-1585-131718-0001 THE WALLY VENTERS HARD 
lbi-1585-131718-0002 YOU CAN SOMETIMES WITH CAPITAL TO HELP HIM THE WORKING OF HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL CAUSED A PERSONAL SURRENDER 
lbi-1585-131718-0003 WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED WE EVENTUALLY MAKES ITS APPEARANCE ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOUR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE ASPARAGUS OR FORBID ITS VALUES 
lbi-1585-131718-0004 POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTIMISM AS REVEALING THE RATION THE SEEKING THE HIGHEST GOOD THAT SOME CHECK 
lbi-1585-131718-0005 POSSIBLY THE LETTERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVATISM DID NOT ALSO PLATE SALUTATORY PART INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVED FORWARD AS A WHOLE 
lbi-1585-131718-0006 ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAD BEEN WRATH VANISHED 
lbi-1585-131718-0007 YET THE VERY VULGAR OF ELECTRIC ARC LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT 
lbi-1585-131718-0008 A NUMBER OF PARENT OUR LINE COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY VOCAL COMPASS HAD BEEN CAUGHT AND SOOTHING AND A FRANCHISE FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REG'LAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR A STRAIGHT LINE 
lbi-1585-131718-0009 THUS IN A CARELESS MANNER THE MONARCH OF THE LATTER LINE WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE REVERIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRED IN FACT WHERE ULTIMATE UNITS OF THE FORCE WAS INEVITABLE 
lbi-1585-131718-0010 AND TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ADMINISTRATION WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CROWDED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT 
lbi-1585-131718-0011 IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MINING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND RECLINING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THOU O FOOD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT 
lbi-1585-131718-0012 IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE RESIDENCE OF THE MATCH NO ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVING CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT ADDISON LINING COVETOUS AND ELUSIVENESS 
lbi-1585-131718-0013 THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS AND A SCREW 
lbi-1585-131718-0014 THERE ARE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN 
lbi-1585-131718-0015 THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE OUR CLIMATE BUT INDIFFERENT ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ENEMIES 
lbi-1585-131718-0016 HERE AGAIN RISK EVEN THE MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT ON SUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR HIS ANTAGONIST 
lbi-1585-131718-0017 THIS WAS NOT LONG KNOWN UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHONE AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF CITIZENS THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROGRESS ARE UNITED UNDER ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN THE FRIENDLY AND PROGRESS AWAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANT 
lbi-1585-131718-0018 THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN YOU YOURSELF 
lbi-1585-131718-0019 SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WERE PLENTY 
lbi-1585-131718-0020 BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER IN OUR SHOES NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL 
lbi-1585-131718-0021 OF COURSE A GREAT MANY CANS WERE WRITTEN AND READ BUT WHY A NEW INTEREST WAS AROUSED IT WAS NECESSARILY A PATHETIC 
lbi-1585-131718-0022 WE GOT OUT AT A GREAT BARGAIN AND ONLY PAID A SMALL SUM DAMN AND THE BALLAST AND WATER GAUGE 
lbi-1585-131718-0023 WE SELL THEM FOR FORTY CENTS BUT THEY WERE ONLY ABOUT TWENTY WITH THOUSANDS OF THEM 
lbi-1585-131718-0024 THE FOURTH YEAR I GOT A DANCE WITH THIRTY SEVEN CENTS AND AMID ALL THE MONEY OUT IN ONE YEAR THAN I HAD AS PREVIOUSLY 
lbi-1585-131718-0025 ONE OF THE INCIDENTS WHICH CAUSED VERY GREAT CHIMNEY WAS THAT WHEN WE STARTED ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PROCESSES HAD TO BE DONE BY EXPERTS 
lbi-1585-131718-0026 AFTER FEELING AROUND FOR SOME DAYS I GOT A CLUE HOW TO DO IT 
lbi-1585-131718-0027 I THEN MADE ANOTHER MACHINE WHICH DID THE WORK NICELY 
lbi-1585-131718-0028 INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE DOUBTED AS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE PRONG BROUGHT TO NOTICE THAT WHILE HE HAD THE FACTORY AT HARRISON AND IMPLORING A CHINESE TRADER WENT TO HIM AND WANTED A DYNAMO TO BE RUN BY HAND POWER 
lbi-1585-131718-0029 FOR MAKING THE DYNAMOS ADDISON SECURED AS NOTED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER THAT WELSH I WORSE AN GO WHERE SWEET NEW YORK AND THIS WAS ALSO EQUIPPED 
lbi-1585-131718-0030 TO SIGMUND BIRDMAN WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY WITH ADDISON AND TELEPHONE THE PATTESON PHONOGRAPHS AND WAS ALREADY MAKING ADDISON SPECIAL NOTICE IN A SMALL WAY ALOFT ON WOOSTER STREET NEW YORK WAS ASSIGNED THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING SOCKETS FIXTURES EATERS CITY FUSES NUMEROUS OTHER DETAILS 
lbi-1585-131718-0031 IN THE EARLY PART OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE THAT AN ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY LEAST DALICHAMP FASHION AT SIXTY FIVE FIFTH AVENUE CLOSE TO FOURTEENTH STREET FOR HIS HEADQUARTERS AND SHOW ROOMS 
lbi-1585-131718-0032 THIS WAS ONE OF THE FINEST HOMES IN THE CITY OF THE PERIOD AND ITS ACQUISITION WAS SUPREME MIND WHICH TIME OF THE SURRENDER OF THE FAMOUS RESIDENCE SHOULD EVER NEWCOMERS 
lbi-1585-131718-0033 THEY EXPERIENCED A LITTLE GAS ENGINE WAS RATHER STARTLING 
lbi-1585-131718-0034 ONE DAY IT WAS NOT GOING VERY WELL AND WHEN DONE TO THE MAN IN CHARGE AND GOT ITS POURING RANT 
lbi-1585-131718-0035 THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEAR SINCE IF I WAS A VERITABLE BEEHIVE DAY AND NIGHT 
lbi-1585-131718-0036 THE ROUTINE WAS VERY MUCH THE SAME AS THAT AT THE LABORATORY INGOTS ON A NECKLET OF A CLOCK 
lbi-1585-131718-0037 I WAS TELLING A GENTLEMAN ONE DAY THAT I COULD NOT KEEP A SECRET EVEN IF I LOCKED THEM UP IN MY DESK THERE WOULD BREAK IT OPEN 
lbi-1585-131718-0038 HE SUGGESTED TO ME THAT HE HAD A FRIEND OVER ON EIGHTH AVENUE WHO MAY DISAPPEAR AT GREATER SECRETS AND WHO WOULD SHOW THEM A TRICK 
lbi-1585-131718-0039 HE SAID THAT HE WOULD HAVE SOME OF THE MATE AND WITH HAIR AND O PAPER AND I COULD PUT THEM ON WITHOUT A WORD AND SEE THAT SHE'S OUT 
lbi-1585-131718-0040 I THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT THE MATTER 
lbi-1585-131718-0041 I DIDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT IT 
lbi-1585-131718-0042 I WAS TOO BUSY ON OTHER THINGS TO NOTICE 
lbi-1585-131718-0043 SPEAKING OF THOSE DAYS OF KNIGHTS ADDISON SAYS YEARS AGO ONE OF THE GREAT VIOLINIST WAS ROMANY 
lbi-1585-131718-0044 WHO WOULD TALK WITH ME THAT I NEVER ASKED HIM TO BRING HIS VIOLIN 
lbi-1585-131718-0045 ONE NIGHT HE CAME WITH HIS VIOLIN ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK 
lbi-1585-131718-0046 AFTER THAT EVERY TIME HE CAME TO NEW YORK HE USED TO CALL IT DEFY LATE AT NIGHT WITH HIS VIOLIN 
lbi-1585-131718-0047 ANOTHER VISITOR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AMUSEMENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SHAW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRE BRIGADE 
lbi-1585-131718-0048 WHO'LL GO OUT AMONG THE FINE LADIES AND HAVE A GREAT TIME 
lbi-1585-131718-0049 SPEAKING OF TALENT ARE AS I WAS TELLING A MAN ARRIVES AT THE HOUSE AND THE INFANTRY IN THE YARD AS HE WAS LEAVING 
lbi-1585-131718-0050 IT WAS WINTER AND HE WAS ALWAYS FIRST 
lbi-1585-131718-0051 I HAD NOTHING TO PROTECT ME AGAINST A CODE 
lbi-1585-131718-0052 THE GOB PLEURISY AND HAD TO BE SHIPPED TO FLORIDA PROCURED 
lbi-1585-131718-0053 HE HAD MERELY ENJOY THE DELIGHTS OF ANXIOUS ANTICIPATION AND A PERILOUS PLEASURE OF PACKING ADDISON'S EXPERIMENTS 
lbi-1585-131718-0054 NOW AFTER EXPLOITATION WAS REQUIRED 
lbi-8288-274150-0000 AND AGAIN WHEN THE ARTIST FOLLOWING MALICORN ADVICE A LITTLE LATE IN ARRIVING AND WHEN SAINT AGNES HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO BE ABSENT FOR SOME TIME IT WAS INTERESTING TO OBSERVE THAT THOUGH NO ONE WITNESSED IN THOSE MOMENTS OF SILENCE FULL OF DEEP EXPRESSION WHICH UNITED IN ONE SIDE TWO SOULS MOST DISPOSED TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER AND WHO BY NO MEANS OBJECTED TO THE QUIET MEDITATION THEY ENJOYED TOGETHER 
lbi-8288-274150-0001 AN OUTWARD MALICORN PHILOSOPHER THAT HE WAS THOUGH HE KNEW IT NOT HAD LEARNED HOW TO INSPIRE THE KING WITH AN APPETITE IN THE MIDST OF PLENTY AND WITH DESIRE AND THE ASSURANCE OF POSSESSION 
lbi-8288-274150-0002 IN THIS MANNER THEREFORE WITHOUT LEAVING HER ROOM AND HAVING NO CONFIDANT SHE WAS ABLE TO RETURN TO HER APARTMENT THUS REMOVING BY HER APPEARANCE A LITTLE TARDY PERHAPS THE SUSPICIONS OF THE MOST DETERMINED SKEPTIC 
lbi-8288-274150-0003 BUT THE DOOR REMAINED CLOSED AND NEITHER SAINT AGNES NOR THE PAINTER APPEARED NOR DID THE HANGINGS EVEN 
lbi-8288-274150-0004 GLYNNE DEAREST ENOUGH SAID THE KING THAT RETURN QUICKLY 
lbi-8288-274150-0005 NO NO NOT TO DAY SIR 
lbi-8288-274150-0006 I KNEW BUT TOO WELL THAT YOU HAD NOT CEASED TO LOVE ME 
lbi-8288-274150-0007 VALERIE WITH A GESTURE PARTLY OF EXTREME TERROR AND PARTLY AS IF INVOKING A BLESSING ATTEMPTED TO SPEAK BUT COULD NOT ARTICULATE ONE WORD 
lbi-8288-274150-0008 AT THE MOMENT HOWEVER WHEN THE KING THREW HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES A CRY OF UTTER DESPAIR RANG THROUGH THE CORRIDOR ACCOMPANIED BY THE SOUND OF RETREATING FOOTSTEPS 
lbi-8288-274162-0000 THE CAPTAIN SITTING BURIED IN HIS LEATHER ARM CHAIR HIS SPURS FIXED ON THE FLOOR HIS SWORD BETWEEN HIS LEGS WAS READING A NUMBER OF LETTERS AS HE TWISTED HIS MOUSTACHE 
lbi-8288-274162-0001 D'ARTAGNAN UTTERED A WELCOME FULL OF PLEASURE WHEN HE RECEIVED HIS FRIEND'S SON 
lbi-8288-274162-0002 OH MY BOY HE SAID BY WHAT A LUCKY INCIDENT AS IT HAPPENED THAT THE KING HAS CALLED YOU 
lbi-8288-274162-0003 THESE WORDS DID NOT SOUND AGREEABLY IN THE YOUNG MAN'S EARS WHO AS HE SEATED HIMSELF REPLIED UPON MY WORD I CANNOT TELL YOU ALL THAT I KNOW IS I HAVE COME BACK HOME 
lbi-8288-274162-0004 THAT THE KING HAS NOT CALLED YOU AND YOU HAVE WRITTEN 
lbi-8288-274162-0005 I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT ON 
lbi-8288-274162-0006 ROSE ALREADY PALE ENOUGH AND HE NOW BEGAN TO TURN HIS HAT ROUND AND ROUND IN HIS HAND 
lbi-8288-274162-0007 WHAT THE DEUCE IS THE MATTER THAT YOU LOOK AS YOU DO AND WHAT MAKES YOU SO DUMB

lbi-1585-157660-0005 THE DEVIL'S TAVERN WAS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AUTHORS BOHEMIANS LORDS AND LADIES WHO DID NOT RETIRE EARLY TO THEIR DOWNY COUCHES 
lbi-1585-157660-0006 WELL M M I SOW SOON FOUND REST IN DEEP SLUMBER AND WAFTED AWAY INTO A DREAMLESS RIM OUR TIRED BODIES LAYING THE ENFOLDING ARMS AMORPHOUS ONTO THE POT A KNOCK AT OUR DOOR NEXT MORNING AS THE CLOCK OF THE TOWER STRUCK THE HOUR OF NINE

lbi-1585-157660-0008 OFT EXPECTATION FAUST AND MOST OFT THERE WHERE MOST PROMISES AND OFT A HITS WHERE HOPE IS COLDEST AND DESPAIR MOST FITS 
lbi-1585-157660-0009 DUCIS ONE DOUBLE WHEN SIXTUS TRAGICALLY 
lbi-1585-157660-0010 WELCOME TO THE GREAT AMAZEMENT OF THE SAILOR FLUNG A GUINEA THAT SENT A POT WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY TAPPED BY JACK WHILE THE OTHERS LOOKED ON IN SILENT EXPECTATION

lbi-1585-157660-0014 IF HE HAD JOBBED OUT OF CLOUDS WILLEM COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE PLEASED AND SURPRISED AND THE FEELING WAS RECIPROCAL 
lbi-1585-157660-0015 THE PRINTING SHOP AFFAIR WAS ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE DOVE WAS TAME AND WE WERE INVITED TO VISIT THE ESTABLISHMENT 
lbi-1585-157660-0016 JAMES BURBAGE GAZED FOR A MOMENT ON THE MANLY FORM A WILLIN AND BLURTED OUT IN HIS BLUFF MANNER WHAT DO YOU KNOW 
lbi-1630-102884-0000 IN MY RECENT TRAVELS IN THE WEST I FOUND THAT OUT THEIR FREEDOM AS AN IDEA HAS BECOME FEEBLE AND INEFFECTUAL 
lbi-1630-102884-0001 THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING NOW BUT THE PEOPLE OF THE WEST 
lbi-1630-102884-0002 THEY HAVE FLATTERED INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY ARE FREE AND THEY HAVE THE SOVEREIGN POWER IN THEIR HANDS 
lbi-1630-102884-0003 AS IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE EVIDENT TO ME THAT THE IDEAL OF FREEDOM HATH GROWN TENDERNESS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE BEST 
lbi-1630-102884-0004 THE MENTALITY IS THAT OF A SLAVE OWNING COMMUNITY BUT A MUTILATED MULTITUDE OF MEN TIED TO ITS COMMOTION AND POLITICAL TREGENNA 
lbi-1630-102884-0005 HE WHO CARES TO HAVE SLAVES MUST CHAIN HIMSELF TO THEM HE WHO BEGINS TO CREATE EXCLUSION FOR OTHERS ABATED FLORENCE ACROSS ASSUMED FREEDOM HE WHO DISTRUSTS FREEDOM ANOTHER'S LUTHER'S MARLIN RIGHT TO IT 
lbi-1630-102884-0006 HAVE THE QUIET A TRUE LOVE OF FREEDOM 
lbi-1630-102884-0007 THE GREAT EPIC OF THE SOUND OF A PEOPLE THE MAHATMA PATTED THE GIFTS AS A WONDERFUL VISION OF AN OVERFLOWING LIFE FOOTING AFTER FREEDOM OF INQUIRY AND EXPERIMENT 
lbi-1630-102884-0008 IN THE AGE OF THE BUDDHA CAME HUMANITY MUSTARD IN A COUNTRY TO ITS UTTERMOST DEPTHS 
lbi-1630-102884-0009 ACCOUNTANT IN TWENTY TWO A NOTE CONSTRUCTION 
lbi-1630-102884-0010 THE ORGANIC UNITY OF A VARIED AND ELASTIC SOCIETY GAVE WAY TO A CONVENTIONAL WHICH PROVED ITS ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER BY THE INEXORABLE LAW OF EXCLUSION 
lbi-1630-102884-0011 LIFE HATH AT PHEENY QUANTITIES I ADMIT BUT BY A NATURAL AND NOT IN HARMONY WITH THE VITAL FUNCTIONS 
lbi-1630-102884-0012 BY SQUEEZING HUMAN BEINGS AND THE GRAPE OFTEN AN ELASTIC SYSTEM AND FEEBLY HOLDING THEM FIXED WE HAVE IGNORED THE NEWS OF LIFE AND GROWTH 
lbi-1630-102884-0013 THE FIRST LIVING THING TO OPPOSE AN IMPASSIVITY MAKING THEM INCAPABLE OF MISLEADING CIRCUMSTANCE DEBATE ON INTRINSIC DEFINE AND OF MOSS TROOPING BADEN DESTINY 
lbi-1630-102884-0014 A STUPEFACTION HATH BECOME SO ABSOLUTE THAT WE DO NOT EVEN REALIZE THAT THIS PERSISTENT MISFORTUNE DOGGING US CHAPS GO AGES CANNOT BE A MERE ACCIDENT OF HISTORY REMOVABLE ONLY BY ANOTHER ACCIDENT FROM OUTSIDE 
lbi-1630-102884-0015 IT MAY EVEN BE INCAPABLE OF HOLDING A JUST FREEDOM IN POLITICS AND OF FIGHTING IN FREEDOM'S CAUSE 
lbi-1630-102884-0016 IT REPRESENTS THE ACTIVE ASPECT OF INERTIA WHICH HAS THE APPEARANCE OF FREEDOM BUT NOT TO SHOOT AND THAT FOOL GETS THRICE TO SLAVERY BOTH WITHIN ITS BOUNDARIES AND OUTSIDE 
lbi-1630-141772-0000 ON THE PLADSEN HEIGHTS HE HAD FOLDED THE FLAG STAFF IN HIS HAND LAY FRIENDS AND TRUE BLUE GONOROWSKY BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY UTTERING A LOUD AND PITEOUS AND CHILDLIKE MOON

lbi-1630-141772-0006 YACHTING THIS TRANSFER HE FELT A LITTLE STRONGER AND WAS ABLE TO LOOK ABOUT HIM AND EVEN SPEAK 
lbi-1630-141772-0007 HE ASKED ON SEEING THE PRISONERS 
lbi-1630-141772-0008 I COMMANDED AS CORTIN REPLIED REGNAN

lbi-1630-141772-0014 HIS FAITH SHONE WITH SATISFACTION AND PLEASURE 
lbi-1630-141772-0015 THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD CARRIED PRINCE ANDREW HAD NOTICED AND TAKEN THE LITTLE GOLD IKON PRINCESS MARY HAD HUNG ROUND HER BROTHER'S NECK BUT SEEING THE FAVOUR THE EMPEROR SHOWED THE PRISONERS THEY NOW HASTENED TO RETURN TO THE HOLY IMAGE 
lbi-1630-141772-0016 PRINCE ANDREW DID NOT SEE HOW AND BY WHOM IT WAS REPLACED BY DAYLIGHT AN IKON WITH ITS THIN GOLD CHAIN THIRTY APPEARED UPON HIS CHEST OUTSIDE HIS UNIFORM 
lbi-1630-141772-0017 HOW GOOD IT WOULD BE TO KNOW THAT A SEQUEL HAD IN THIS LIFE AND EXPECT OFTEN BEYOND THE GULLY 
lbi-1630-141772-0018 HOW HAPPY AND CALM I SHOULD BE IF I COULD NOW SEE LORD HAVE MERCY ON ME

lbi-1630-73710-0002 IT MAKES THE HEART ACHE BUT TO PICTURE SUCH VICISSITUDES TO THE IMAGINATION 
lbi-1630-73710-0003 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH CHANGES CAN ECHO FLICKS OVER THE MIND LIKE THE THOUGHT OF DEBT THAT SCOUTING AROUND GAY FANCIES THAT BATLIKE WING AND CHANGING THE HEAVY ATMOSPHERE OF A HAPPINESS THAT VENOMOUS EXPLORATIONS

lbi-1651-136854-0001 THE EAGLE WHICH HE CHOSE WAS THAT OF A PERIODICAL PAPER WHICH HE KNEW HAD BEEN UPON FORMER OCCASIONS EMPLOYED WITH GREAT SUCCESS 
lbi-1651-136854-0002 WHEN I WAS TO BEGIN PUBLISHING THAT PAPER I WAS AT A LOSS HOW TO NAME IT 
lbi-1651-136854-0003 I SAT DOWN UPON MY BED SIDE AND RESOLVED THAT I WOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP TILL I HAD FIXED ITS TITLE 
lbi-1651-136854-0004 ADDISON'S NOTE WAS A FICTION IN WHICH UNCONNECTED FRAGMENTS OF HIS LUCUBRATIONS WERE PURPOSELY JUMBLED TOGETHER IN HIS AUTOMATIC AS HE COULD IN ORDER TO PRODUCE A LAUGHABLE EFFECT

lbi-1651-136854-0006 FOR INSTANCE THERE IS THE FOLLOWING SPECIMEN 
lbi-1651-136854-0007 PUBLIC CALAMITIES NO SENSE OF THE PREVALENCE OF BAD HABITS NEGLIGENT OF TIME READY TO UNDERTAKE CARELESS TO PURSUE ALL CHANGED BY TIME 
lbi-1651-136854-0008 CONFIDENCE OTHERS UNSUSPECTING AS UNEXPERIENCED IMAGINING HIMSELF SECURE AGAINST NEGLECT NEVER IMAGINE THEY WILL VENTURE TO TREAT HIM ILL READY TO FROST EXPECTING TO BE TRUSTED 
lbi-1651-136854-0009 YOU ARE AMBITIOUS AS THINKING HONORS EASY TO BE HAD 
lbi-1651-136854-0010 DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRAISE PURSUED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS 
lbi-1651-136854-0011 OF THE FANCY IN MANHOOD 
lbi-1651-136854-0012 RAY 
lbi-1651-136854-0013 SCHOLARS FRIENDSHIP LIKE LADIES 
lbi-1651-136854-0014 DRAWN TO MAN BY WORDS REPELLED BY PASSIONS 
lbi-1651-136854-0015 COMMON DANGER UNITES BY CRUSHING OTHER PASSIONS BUT THEY WERE TO HER 
lbi-1651-136854-0016 EQUALITY HINDERS COMPLIANCE 
lbi-1651-136854-0017 SUPERIORITY INTRODUCES INCIDENTS AND ENVY 
lbi-1651-136854-0018 TOO MUCH REGARD AND EACH TO PRIVATE INTEREST TOO LITTLE 
lbi-1651-136854-0019 OF CONFEDERACY WITH SUPERIOR AS EVERYONE KNOWS THE INCONVENIENCE 
lbi-1651-136854-0020 WITH EQUALS NO AUTHORITY EVERY MAN HIS OWN OPINION HIS OWN INTEREST 
lbi-1651-136854-0021 MAN AND WIFE HARDLY UNITED SCARCE EVER WITHOUT CHILDREN 
lbi-1651-136854-0022 COMPUTATION IS TWO TO ONE AGAINST TWO HOW MANY AGAINST FIVE 
lbi-1651-136854-0023 IN THIS AS IN MANY OTHER CASES OR GO WRONG IN OPPOSITION TO CONVICTION FOR I THINK SCARCE ANY TEMPORAL GOOD EQUALLY TO BE DESIRED WITH REGARD AND FAMILIARITY OF WORTHY MEN 
lbi-1651-136854-0024 I HOPE WE SHALL BE SOME TIME NEARER TO EACH OTHER AND HAVE A MORE READY WAY OF POURING OUT OUR HEARTS 
lbi-1651-136854-0025 THE GREATEST BENEFIT WHICH ONE FRIEND CAN CONFER UPON ANOTHER IS TO GOD AND EXCITE AND ELEVATE HIS VIRTUES 
lbi-1651-136854-0026 THIS YOUR MOTHER WILL STILL PERFORM IF YOU DILIGENTLY PRESERVED THE MEMORY OF HER LIFE AND FOR DEATH OR LIFE SO FAR AS I CAN LEARN THE FULL WISE AND INNOCENT AND DEATH RESIGNED PEACEFUL AND HOLY 
lbi-1651-136854-0027 I CANNOT FORBEAR TO MENTION THAT NEITHER REASON NOR REVELATION DENIES YOU TO HOPE THAT YOU MAY INCREASE HER HAPPINESS BY OBEYING HER PRECEPTS AND SHE MAY IN HER PRESENT STATE LOOK WITH PLEASURE UPON EVERY ACT OF VIRTUE TO WHICH HER INSTRUCTIONS OR EXAMPLE HAVE CONTRIBUTED 
lbi-1651-136854-0028 IF YOU WRITE DOWN MY NEWLY WHAT YOU A NUMBER OF HER FROM YOUR EARLIEST YEARS YOU WILL READ IT WITH GREAT PLEASURE AND RECEIVE FROM IT MANY HINTS OF SOOTHING RECOLLECTION WHEN TIME SHALL REMOVE HER YET FARTHER FROM YOU AND YOUR GRIEF SHALL BE RICHER TO VENERATION 
lbi-1651-136854-0029 NUMBER THIRTY TWO ON PATIENCE EVEN UNDER EXTREME MISERY IS WONDERFULLY LOFTY AND AS MUCH ABOVE THE RANT OF STOICISM AS THE SUN OF REVELATION IS BRIGHTER THAN THE TWILIGHT OF PAGAN PHILOSOPHY 
lbi-1651-136854-0030 IT MUST INDEED BE ALLOWED THAT THE STRUCTURE OF HIS SENTENCES IS EXPANDED AND OFTEN HAS SOMEWHAT OF THE INVERSION OF LONDON AND THAT HE DELIGHTED TO EXPRESS FAMILIAR FAULTS IN PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE BEING IN THIS THE REVERSE OF SOCRATES WHO IT WAS SAID REDUCED PHILOSOPHY TO THE SIMPLICITY OF COMMON LIFE 
lbi-1651-136854-0031 THIS IDLE CHARGE HAS BEEN ECHOED FROM ONE BABYLON TO ANOTHER WHO HAVE CONFOUNDED JOHNSON'S ESSAYS WITH JOHNSON'S DICTIONARY AND BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HIS WRITING IN THE LEXICON OF OUR LANGUAGE TO COLLECT MANY WORDS WHICH HAD FALLEN INTO DISUSE BUT WERE SUPPORTED BY GREAT AUTHORITIES RICHES BUT IMAGINED THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN INTERWOVEN INTO HIS OWN COMPOSITIONS 
lbi-1651-136854-0032 THEIR STYLES DIFFERS PLAIN CLOTH AND BROCADE 
lbi-1686-142278-0000 HE WAS GONE

lbi-1686-142278-0003 HAY WAS BEING DISTURBED AND UNHAPPY EXERTIONS THEY HAD MADE ANYTHING BUT A REFUSAL IMPOSSIBLE WHILE HE NOT MANY MINUTES AFTER HE HAD MET WITH REJECTION OF WHAT OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN THE DEEPEST HOLIEST REPOSE IN ALL HIS LIFE COULD SPEAK AS IF ITS SUCCESS AND ON A SUPERFICIAL CONSEQUENCE IS OF A GOOD HOUSE CLEVER AND AGREEABLE SOCIETY WORTHY SO AVOWED OBJECTS ABUSED HIS EYES OH DEAR 
lbi-1686-142278-0004 WHEN I CAME INTO THE ROOM BEFORE THE SWIRL OF THOUGHTS WAS ADJUSTED TO ANYTHING LIKE ORDER

lbi-1686-142278-0007 MARGARET WAS PREPARING HER MOTHER'S WORSTED WORK AND RATHER SHRINKING FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE LONG EVENING AND WISHING THAT TIME WILL COME THAT SHE MIGHT GO OVER THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AGAIN

lbi-1686-142278-0011 MISTER LENNOX AND NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING ANY PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER FATHER OFF TO HER REFUSAL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SERIOUS AFFAIR 
lbi-1686-142278-0012 BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATELY IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED COULD HAVE GIVEN RISE TO MANY COMPLICATED THOUGHTS AND IF FATHER WISHED TO SPEAK TO HER 
lbi-1686-142278-0013 MISTER HALE DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MINUTE OR TWO 
lbi-1686-142278-0014 MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUSPENSE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DISTRESSING TO HAVE FATHER UNTO HERSELF
