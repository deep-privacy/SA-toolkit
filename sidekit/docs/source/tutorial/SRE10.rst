NIST-SRE 2010
=============

| NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation have been organized by the
| National Institute for Standard and Technologies (US) since 1997.
| Those evaluation have become a standard amongst the scientific community
| and are well used to develop and evaluate the speaker recognition systems.
| The proposed tutorials are based on the NIST-SRE 2010 extended protocol and makes use 
| of previous evaluation data to train the systems (NIST-SRE 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2008)
|
| More information can be found on `NIST-SRE website <http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/mig/spkr-lang.cfm>`_.

Three tutorials are proposed here to train three i-vectors systems.
