# README

This toolkit is greatly based on [pkwrap](https://github.com/idiap/pkwrap/blob/e2836a8de516e5ab2030e998bc8f07109d3385eb/README.md) another python wrapper for Kaldi.

Many thanks to the pkwrap authors for providing an extensible toolkit in which I was able to modify to add many features required to build a speaker anonymization toolkit.
